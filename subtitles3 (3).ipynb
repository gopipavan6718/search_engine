Big, fat rip off , , Between this and this was nine bucks , , And I was like, \\\"Why the hell is everything, , , everything so ridiculously expensive?\\\" , , [man] Hey, lady , , [Speir] Initially, we all felt we were pulling the same\\u00c2 direction, , , putting together this amazing festival no matter the cost , , Why don't you just give me a list of the things you need? , , [man, over phone] What I need is at least $ , , , But then, we all started to get the feeling , , that corners were being cut , , So, sincerely as I could possibly be, I really want to thank everybody , , I mean, you guys have been unbelievable , , You've done a fantastic job , , You know, this is an extraordinary experience , , There is nothing like this that happens anywhere in the world , , That being said, um, this is a money making venture, all right? , , And that was the moment for me where it stopped becoming , , about the concert goer or the festival goer experience , , It was just cutting budgets, cutting budgets , , We need to make changes We're not making profits , , Their goal was to make money , , And what they ended up doing was selling the food rights , , Well, wonderful Coca Cola , , [Rosenblatt] And unfortunately, when they did that deal, , , the group that ran that for them had complete control over the pricing, , , and we could do nothing about it , , All hopes and dreams of Peace, Love, and Understanding , , went out the window , , [Rowland] The underpinning reason of why there was ' was to make money , , So, I think absolutely some of the sensibilities fell away , , for the big, you know the big payday , , You're watching Woodstock ' ! You're watching Woodstock ' ! , , [crowd] Whoo! , , Rolling four , , I mean, we also wanted to do pay per view , , So people who weren't there could still participate , , [announcer] Stay home for the trip of your life on pay per view , , It was a package price of $ for all three days , , And that yielded a lot of money , , Whoo!

letters mm and other items like oh an opera program and a lace handkerchief a and a photograph of her ladyship mementos you might say they must have meant a lot to captain hammond kept them locked in a tin box he did along with his decorations how come you uh you got hold of them then hmm oh i was his batman you see ah like brothers we were fighting side by side with the afridis coming at us through the khyber pass yelling their heathen cries im proud to say i polished off the one that got the captain got him you mean this uh this captain hammond is uh hes dead is he a knife straight through the liver exhales sharply oh he never suffered i think i think her ladyship would like to know that now hang on a minute now when when an officer dies they they send his stuff home dont they i i mean to his relatives i mean uh true that is the usual practice yes how the hell do you come to get them well you see like i uh i felt that i still had a duty towards the deceased oh yeah yeah now the captain often used to talk to me about his wedded sister living in cheltenham oh very fond of her he was very fond and i was afraid that shed got enough of a shock as it was hearing about the captains death you know without discovering from the letters that he had been canoodling with a married woman and her the wife of a tory m p at that do you follow me look you know what you should have done with those letters dont you burnt them to ashes the lot of them well it occurred to me that her ladyship might prefer to have them back yeah yeah women can be very sentimental about such things you know yeah well look i uh i tell you what mr dooley you give me those letters and ill make sure she gets them back all right uh no no no i dont think thatd be very proper no i tell you what you have a word with her ladyship and uh tell her the circumstances and arrange for her to receive me huh scoffs and if theres any question of a reward ill see you right now i cant say fairer than that now can i a reward what sort of uh reward were you thinking of you all right in the top story are you no letters are worth these ones are and theyre for sale only do you know what i think mr dooley what i think you made all this up make what up all this about captain hammond now you just stay where you are taffy and ill show you a sample of my wares there theres one see and i have a whole bundle

can spare you well whats that supposed to mean well i wonder if shed go out driving quite so often if her chauffeur was years old with curly teeth the rest of the staff think shes taken quite a shine to you who her ladyship mm never well why else did she give that rise last month well for my uh outstanding presentability and all round skill thats roughly what i thought do you know it reminds me a bit of ada liversedge ada liversedge mm she was on the bill with me at the oxton empire monologues and refined juggling lovely act proper lady muck she was butter wouldnt melt well one night we come in early and we found her in the pipe room with the theater fireman it was the uniform you see all them buttons so you better watch out my boy chuckles yeah well you dont have to worry sarah you do what you like its no skin off my nose i cant see a lady of quality losing her head over one of her own servants oh they do sometimes so ive heard tell quite grand ladies have you ever heard tell of lady marjorie going off the rails how should i know oh its just that i thought you knew most of what went on in this house thats all what you being so helpful all of a sudden for eh sarah oh its just an excuse to come and talk to you really rose it seems goodness knows how long since we had a chat not much to chat about anymore you got your life i got mine rose well its true i dont know how to i dont know where i am with you no more sometimes i think i was better off in the old days when you and me used to share that room together do you remember we used to lie awake at night and talk about all the things we was gonna do yeah well you did one or two of them didnt you yes oh well it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all whats that supposed to mean i daresay you got that much out of all that memories rose memories oh yeah well i wasnt cut out for the humdrum bonds of marriage do you see me washing some fellas socks and wiping his childrens runny noses no i cant not now you mention it but just cause you dont fancy it dont mean to say its not a good idea oh youd like it wouldnt you yes i would only i dont seem to get no offers give us your hand what for come on i might be able to see well youve got nothing to worry about have you see its all there clear as daylight see all them little lines yeah what are they children rose mm yes one a year till oh poo if the first ones a girl will you call her sarah after me course i will you can be godmother if you like i would the nearest ill ever get to having one of me own dont say that im sure youll find somebody thought i had captain james oh sarah you didnt really think i did rose really oh i know hes a bit of a philanderer but i thought hed settle down like his father now thats what i call an ideal marriage years of wedded bliss them two upstairs and bet in all that time shes never looked at another fella what makes you so sure well shes not the type is she looks can lie sometimes what do you mean rose well between you me and the gatepost lady marjories had her little moments only its not to go beyond these four walls little moments lady marjorie do you mean another gentleman mm it must have been when you was away you could almost say she cast her bonnet over a windmill who with rose well go on tell me you swear you wont breathe a word to a living soul i cross my heart now tell well he was in the army same as captain james a couple of years older maybe blue eyes ever so romantic looking younger than her ladyship of course well captain james brought him to the house one evening her ladyship took one look at him and she was done for chuckles it sounds like one of them magazine stories that mrs bridges says is only fit for scullery maids be that as it may miss roberts always said they fell in love at the opera soft music dimming lights mm did the master know course not silly but we all did belowstairs see this captain hammond he was on leave from india and hed taken rooms in ebury street she used to go there in the afternoon mrs bridges saw her she saw her coming out all felled and mysterious looking so we knew something was up he used to send her flowers every day with bits of poetry attached and she used to write him billet doux how do you know um well the blotter in her boudoir we used to hold it up against the mirror you could see the writing ever so clearly how long ago was all this about three years and uh how did how did it end then well this captain hammond went back to india and got killed in action uh mr hudson read about it in the paper rose said they was all dreadfully upset downstairs when he read it out and she said lady marjorie went around looking all pale and sad so that was that nothing to show for her romance but a few fading memories all gone all forgotten not a lock of hair a photograph or even a packet of love letters thats what rose said shame isnt it watkins why are we stopping here i beg your pardon my lady but ive got something most important to say to you surely you can wait i tell you i must get to the jewelers or they wont what on earth do you think youre doing im sorry my lady but uh theres no other way of speaking to you in private you see theres an individual irish i think trying to wheedle some money out of you what do you mean watkins a tradesman of some kind uh no my lady um an old soldier that thats what he says he saw service in india so he says im sure you had a most interesting conversation but i dont want to hear about it now will you please take me to the jewelers as i asked you my lady this man has in his possession some letters letters written by your good self i understand t they are signed so the man claims by your ladyship and and coming from eaton place and to whom does he say they are written these letters to someone by the name of captain hammond my lady well i hardly think that my correspondence with captain hammond would be of interest to anyone he was merely an acquaintance of my sons who came to the house on various occasions oh yes yes i see my lady marjorie i seem to remember reading that he was killed on active service uh yeah thats right my lady uh uh this man dooley was with him when he died dooley a brother officer of captain hammonds no he was the he was the captains batman my lady i see that thats how hed come to be in possession of the letters see and you say this batman is asking for money in exchange for the letters uh yes yes my lady i uh i i thought i ought to make the position clear i hope you dont you dont mind me mentioning it my lady no you did quite right watkins tell me did any of the other servants see this man uh no no my lady uh mr hudson shut the door in his face without asking what he wanted and uh he came round to the mews to try and make himself agreeable to me yes i see watkins i think it might be as well if you didnt mention him to anyone very good my lady i suppose its simply that he he expects some sort of reward in return for lost property thats right my lady thats a great deal of money yes thats thats what i told him my lady when will you be seeing him again well hes hes coming back later this evening would you like to speak to him yourself my lady uh no no i dont think thatll be necessary as you seem to have involved yourself in all this well that was no choice of mine my lady the question is how to raise such a large sum of money in so short a time shall i drive you to the bank my lady no no i i dont want to go to my bank um watkins a are there not establishments where its possible to raise a loan on the security of some possession marjorie you can leave that here watkins ill get hudson to have it sent up later very good my lady oh and i shant need the car again today thank you thomas very good my lady richard there you are my dear psst what happened she was pretty shaken i can tell you turned quite pale she did yeah i told you it was true rose wouldnt make up a thing like that she had to pop a necklace so the master wouldnt find out i got the money how much never you mind teas ready belowstairs ill have to uh have to put the car away oh hang on a minute give us a kiss not in here later thank you rose marjorie you look worried my dear oh im sorry anything the matter no not really i was just thinking about various things james james well wondering whether his regiment might be in action one day i worry about him things are quiet on the northwest frontier at the moment thats good theres been no trouble out there since the fighting with the afridis last year when they had a number of casualties in the um the khyber rifles thats all right then knock on door who is it its me dooley thomas come upstairs its more private and mind your head michael no thanks had a word with her ladyship have you uh yes yes i have i bet it was quite a shock for her the poor soul discovering that her little indiscretion had come to light thought shed got away with it huh no i dont think she thought that what do you mean well it it wasnt such a dark and guilty secret as you imagined see well it ought to be a married woman carrying on like that and her in high society aye well i dont think they pay a great deal of attention to that sort of thing in high society i mean not nowadays well they damn well ought to mm are you telling me that her misbehavior was common knowledge oh no no but i uh i uh i think she made a clean breast of it so i hear to her husband your letters wont tell him anything he doesnt know already huh yeah im sorry mr dooley you seem to have been under a misapprehension yeah those those letters are a lot of useless rubbish man oh i wouldnt be too sure about that now listen she uh she did say shed give you a fiver for them scoffs shed like the photograph see now thats only in the way of charity man upper crust indeed i wouldnt give you twopence for the lot of them mm aye well never mind the twopence mr dooley do you want a fiver or not fiver huh come to think of it maybe there is such a thing as a public duty public duty mm maybe the public has a right to know the way their betters behave themselves in the privacy of their wealthy homes well i dont think its any of their business mr dooley i mean not not the ordinary commoner and who elected mr richard bellamy into parliament will you tell me that the ordinary honest working man thats who put him up there in westminster yeah well i think theyre mostly bank clerks in beckenham mr dooley yeah well maybe they are but are they going to vote for a man who upholds immorality oh no my lad ill soon put a stop to that youll see no i d i dont see mr dooley now what are you gonna do about it stand on street corners giving the letters to anyone passing by is it not at all no there are those who put these facts into print for all to see lord northcliffe to name but one now theres a man with a strong sense of public duty and its just the stuff for the daily mail you think so do you i do and ill tell you something else ill get myself a tidy sum for them letters when i offer them to a newspaper a newspaper oh well thats thats different isnt it tis taffy isnt it its different now yeah well i tell you what ill ill give you the on behalf of her ladyship well you lying welsh bastard oh yeah im sure we can do better than now taffy shell never pay well then youll only have to go to your master wont you after all he is a member of parliament he wont want this sort of stuff to be going into the newspapers now will he quid taffy thats my price hudson you did quite right to inform me mr watkins well i i felt it was my my duty mr hudson chuckles those letters are undoubtedly forgeries i could tell that the man who came round to your mews after id shown him the door was nothing more than a common impostor someone whod obviously taken the trouble to look up the family in debretts peerage oh oh yes yes i see mr hudson and to make up some cock and bull story about her ladyship and and some army officer called oh whatever it was captain hammond quite london is full of such people mr watkins confidence tricksters no less well i im only pleased that theres no truth in in what this man dooley says mr hudson you can put the matter right out of your head thomas well thank you thank you very much mr hudson now get on with your work door opens uh mr watkins but hudson youve been in this house long enough to know that theres nothing involving her ladyship that even lord northcliffe could turn into a scandal oh nothing at all sir i just felt that youd wish to be informed about this mans absurd claims thats right hes probably got hold of letters written by her ladyship to to some relative quite so sir affectionate but entirely innocent im sure youre right sir on the other hand sir one gathers that the wording of the letters renders them open to some uh misrepresentation im sure it does the most harmless correspondence can be twisted in some way people are always ready to believe the worst thats very true sir do you know to whom my wife is supposed to have addressed these letters i dont think theres anything to be gained by repeating slander sir no i see that all the same presumably the innuendo is that her ladyship has had an illicit liaison of some kind i cant get the light to it unless i know who the fellows meant to be you do see my point oh quite sir wheres watkins now ive asked him to wait outside in the hall sir send him in very good sir door opens uh mr watkins footsteps approach oh come in watkins uh hudson tells me a man has

i grew up in maine but in a way i never really lived in maine i think anyone from my part of the world would say the same folks from little tall send their taxes to augusta same as other folks and we

too high then go to the back okay here we go here we go here we go lets go sam get it get it theres a dupe in our group theres a snake how do you feel about the boys so far girl you got this that looked intentional the girls are very fake it could be anybody anyone could be lying come on stop snaking there is money on the line this is no joke this is exactly what the snake would do wyatts acting a little sus to me helicopter whirring when the sun is shining bright i have no idea what im doing out here it looks treacherous its so exciting my bloods just cooking im ready to get on it im former military i was trained to seek and destroy and then on the other hand i also have training as a medic i could cut your throat but then i could also fix it cant keep me down i stand my ground i describe myself as like multi dimensional athletic sociable extroverted im very calm in a game situation honestly i think the type of person that comes out here is a crazy person so i gotta be a little loco you know cant stop now hey hey i have no idea what im getting myself into but i love adventure and i like taking risks and my personality can range from puppy dogs and rainbows to i will cut you cant stop now oh my god thats terrifying i am someone thats rather impulsive i love a good competition because i have a big mouth i like to talk a lot of smack i am not here to please everyone im just here to be authentic and who i am and if they like it great and if they dont everyone cant have great taste hey hey im disappointed in the team thats been handed to me theres an age gap where i could put two of them together and they dont even equal my age but i dont think im gonna have a problem as long as theyll listen to me cant stop now ominous music you must be thinking to yourself what have i gotten myself into what do you think is about to happen i have absolutely no idea first let me introduce myself im bobby bones i will be your guide through what were about to go through youre gonna work as a team but heres the thing that gets a little crazy there is a snake amongst you four dramatic music someone is trying to sabotage the group because if they do theyre going to win isnt it crazy that one of you right now is lying i am not the snake im not the snake i am not the snake im not the snake there are a couple of challenges if youre able to successfully complete a challenge you will open this box right here inside the box is the snake clue that gets you one step closer to finding out who the snake is if you dont pass the challenge that clue disappears forever im gonna have to work with these teammates to accomplish a task but now one of them is gonna try to stop that that is worst case scenario in any mission after the two challenges well meet at the snake pit where you will decide whos the snake i have no idea whos the snake the most important thing is figuring out who the snake is thats where the money is right now youre at your first challenge location and here are the rules located feet above this treacherous canyon there are snake flags the team must use a zip line to grab four snake flags and match them with snake images located on the answer board players may grab one flag at a time and they must avoid the decoys and duplicates on the line if the team can successfully match the four correct flags in minutes or less they will win the first snake clue lets gear up okay so i feel like we should start communicating my strategy is to get people to word vomit i feel like the more people talk they tell on them themselves well yeah lets go ahead and do intro all right uh my name is xavier um im from san francisco but im a college student in los angeles uh and im a student athlete i run track and field and im a model out there too id say im an excellent judge of character im very intuitive i get feelings about people you know so i think i think itll be a no brainer to figure out who it is im elektra i have not done anything like this before so what do you do so i do advertising for a church oh did you say where you were from im from upstate new york what about you guys im wyatt im from florida im married and i have a beautiful daughter who just started college oh wow oh yeah so im former military oh wow so you know what youre doing im also a stuntman wow nice as well as currently a volunteer helicopter rescue swimmer okay oh wow this is totally your element yeah this is your element for sure i just beat cancer so i kind of look at this at being as a chance to prove myself that im not down and out and if i win this money im gonna use it to pay for my daughters college so that she doesnt have to work so she can focus on her studies so my name is sam im from reno nevada but i live in nashville right now but i am a proud dog mom my strategy is to get everyone to trust me people view me as a genuine nice person i like to listen so people confide in me a lot im thinking that i should go first cause id probably get back quicker and then youll go and then shell go third and then sam perfect i am a little bit nervous just because i dont know what to expect we barely know each other but our reward for this challenge is the snake clue the four of us have to work together as a team we have to get this clue all right here we go ready set go all right come on wyatt lets go lets go lets go if you drop a flag youre a snake dramatic music g i joe lets go laughs come on boy all right wyatt come on wyatt ah its too high come on wyatt oh no oh no good no good he did not get a flag oh my god come on there is money on the line this is no joke we are trying to get this coin big swing and a miss for wyatt there theres like a dupe in our group theres a snake its wyatt at this moment in my mind dramatic music it looked bad and if i were my team members i would think it would be me as well i dont know tense music he missed them all no flag god dang it ten minutes remaining i look like the damn snake it is so important for us to successfully win this challenge because we need this clue that will ultimately help us find out who is the snake i think i think so im the friggin snake because i flubbed it up a little bit try to get the first second or third cause i think those are all three that we need we gonna push it to the limit about to set that tone let the name be known come on xavier that looked a smidge intentional im the shaker the mover eliminate the confusion you can do it i dont talk it i do it yes yes lets go whoo yes yes yes yes yes hey lets go snake match i dont feel secure holding it like this oh god oh my god bleep elektra is off and running dramatic music bleep missed the first one elektra coming through for her team getting that flag right there oh my god thats terrifying oh do i have a flag bleep yes oh my god elektra is very fake very very theatrical in everything shes doing a little over a little too much thats hard as bleep drew a suspicion immediately good job that was terrifying ah get it match lets go sam purple or orange just reach okay here we go here we go here we go lets go sam lets go get it get it yeah whoo lets go yeah lets go hold on she better hold on you better not drop it whoo sam saw the flag sam got the flag nice job sam come on sam stop snaking she aint snaking she got us orange baby lets go lets go panting all right all right weve got three correct flags on the board one flag to go for that snake clue which what color do we need purple thats it this is so specific but where is it though on there come on wyatt lets go dont touch the first one bro no the second one its all good he get it yeah he got the first one but im pretty sure thats one we already had grunts wyatts got a flag but were not sure which one that is i got one wyatt brought up the wrong snake one flag to go girl mm hmm elektra and i are stepping up and that in my mind tells me that i can trust her automatically i think all boys are snakes wheres the lie cant find one five minutes left guys you gotta hurry xavier come on you can do it its right in your path need the purple one you can do it grab it its the purple one whoo hoo hoo lets go all right lets go dont drop it oh my god he came through yes he came through yes sir i got purple whoo whoo lets go xavier for the snake clue its good snake clue all cheering yeah lets go im so pumped that we

right now whoo lets get it one of you is not a win for the team is great but its also a loss for the snake when i open this box their identity will be one step closer to being revealed here is your first snake clue uh huh suspenseful music this only child loves cosplay and wears many disguises beware that a snake comes in all shapes and sizes tense music i think that we had gotten that thing tomorrow man i guarantee you one you guys would have talked about being a cosplayer cause i want to know and now youre not gonna tell me all laugh all this getting to know each other is gonna happen at camp okay and thats where youre going next youre gonna head to camp and there youre gonna search for your next clue the coordinates to camp are in your watch i will see you guys tomorrow at the second challenge its in my veins now i feel it look in my eyes theres no way to conceal it nothing is written bet you cant feel it truth or im livin good job today guys we survived it now usually im

orion thats wild what are the odds that yall have twins in the family xavier and elektra have twins in their family thats kind of thats a rare thing so that was kind of interesting to hear something like that oh my gosh its so pretty this is nice not too shabby this is interesting whats over there everybodys already looking for a clue line of ants right here i see little holes im worried about an actual snake oh xavier is this another clue what you guys got back there another clue bust it open bust it open go for it yeah you know what lets not open it yet why why not cause we need to talk man and get some intel before we open it up and find another dead end thats true thats true so save it you want to put it back there lets get to know each other a bit right away wyatt takes charge again and im thinking maybe hes trying to control the game tense music all right team looking like a fire hey we eating tonight i got my marshmallow stick what g i joe lets go blow it out before it goes out thank you so much make a wish whoo did that make you feel home enough man or what yeah it did thank you so much i usually never celebrate my birthday without my twin brother so its like hella weird aw

dakota he has a football scholarship so he plays football out there gee thats whats up yeah wait you both play football no i run track do they know that i was a cheerleader you better come on five six seven eight wait you were a cheerleader thats so cool yeah yep all throughout high school lets start chatting man well hey lets go tell us about you your hobbies cosplay laughter you can try again um i am very connected to the church and i dont partake in the dressing up to cartoon characters for cosplay um i am a baptist woman and we do not play about that the only time i dress up is on sundays tuesdays and thursdays when i am praising almighty so do you sing yes in the choir nice aw something that stood out to me elektra was very religious oh do i have a flag bleep yes oh my god oh my finger bleep bleep but i think shes pretty foulmouthed and im kind of suspicious of that what made you want to come do this honestly stepping out of my comfort zone you know what i mean like i love never ever before anything i do hiking upstate what else can you tell us about you mr interrogation yeah were going damn youre over here like running up on what about yall im an open book you guys can ask me anything im studying nutrition right now nice i try to pick up on clues if someone is lying or telling the truth by how they present themselves and if theyre making eye contact or not my job is just modelling in la i do like content creation and stuff like cosplay no definitely not content creator like the content creator stuff its like on tiktok like for haircare brands and stuff and like for clothes and all that oh xavier is kind of like an influencer so hes really good at getting people to like him he knows how to gain followers and he knows how to put that face on what else yeah we dont know nothing about sam im sorry what about sam sams starting to get snaked out here sam is one that i cant figure out because shes not giving me any tells she is kind of withdrawn that puts a target on her um okay so im sam i have a cute little dog i moved out of my hometown which was a really big step for me but im happy i did it being a single kid is kind of tough huh no i have a little sister shes back home so what sam is the most exciting thing youve ever done in your life you know i went to thailand on a volunteer trip by myself oh wow thats amazing it was so amazing whats the craziest thing youve ever done former military did the navy for eight years the coast guard for six so youve traveled all over huh yeah good for you how many brothers and sisters do you have i have a half brother and i have a stepbrother so thats technically not your biological siblings it said the snake has no siblings i feel like all of us are just kind of looking at each other like okay i dont know man thats a huge red flag should we do our clue while traveling abroad is a part of their past the snake hates the outdoors where they dirty too fast all right huh that is juicy you guys what were you saying again about how many where youve been ive been out of the country a handful of times ive been to laos ive been to mexico ive been in canada wow nice i mean the clues are only clues were gonna have to see how people perform lets remember peoples performances today in the first challenge dude im sorry about that performance today man and you said you havent been out of the country yeah this is my first time and your first time yeah this is my first time too who do you think it might be i feel like its too early to say we havent even done this ah we can get a gut feel i got a i got a suspicion okay im gonna im gonna put my cards on the table and im aiming at you sam chuckles yeah im gonna put my cards on the table and im aiming at you sam why do you think that cause ive been out of the country thats the only other reason i mean on the paper you know people can lie about it i know i know thats true but im just saying apparently i will be transparent i feel like its you oh god i wish i was wait what wait did you just admit it im gonna keep telling you that im not and im gonna tell you that i wish i was we dont want you to tell us we want you to show us in these challenges but i feel like thats what the snake would say though like i wish you know what i mean i think everyone looks a little guilty yeah at this point in the game i can see reasons why everyone could be it whens the last time you went to cosplay i dont i dont cosplay does anyone know someone who does cosplay mm mm right i know sam why you keep pressing her though wyatt is deflecting and calling sam a snake trying to project that onto her its a little suspicious i know g i joe be at the renaissance fairs they dont play with guns in those things you think i want to go in one of those things and play with plastic weapons but youre a man of many trades youve told us a bunch of stuff youre a damn stunt double youve done been to war so i dont put it past you at this point my approach is defending from my experience hard hard hard is a kind of a sign of guilt i think im good so if you guys dont mind i think ima go ahead and brush my teeth and all right this was very constructive you guys it was gives me lots to think about oh my god that is a lot of ants yeah oh no oh my god guys sam screams lets get our bedding ready in fact im gonna make me a damn hammock in the tree with that little sleeping bag i think bro is that a bleep tarantula no no no no no no hell no bleep sam screaming oh hell no no no no not on my watch not on my watch hes like coiling up hes ready to pounce i dont want to seem antisocial but im gonna go to bed soon would a snake kind of only fend for themselves in a sense i love my hammocks thats snake behavior to me in british accent come on over milady get comfy im scared did homey go to sleep grasshopper mer her do you see it laughs you are doing some amanda bynes references and i am digging it dude i used to love amanda bynes the amanda show was my bleep so good so good i would say i do form friendships and bonds quickly i like eggs are you kidding i like eggs iconic and sometimes i will assess that person and see how i can relate to them any way possible i think the bond that im forming with sam is effortless and natural like i just watched shes the man thank you oh my god thats one of my favorite movies im stoked to have someone on my side and i think that we together can find out who the snake is what the bleep is that what a scorpion bro where scorpion oh my bleep god well looks like im not bleep falling asleep now that bleep was huge im not going to sleep dont leave a dragon in the woods your mind is searching ever should if you tie a dragon to a tree i kinda wanna wash my face tense music is this your water yeah i noticed that xavier is really aware about his cleanliness at least i can wash my face and put some deodorant on and then the second clue said that this person doesnt like to get dirty xavier is on my radar again are we all ready all right guys i got the coordinates on the watch looks like were going that way which is north so lets go embrace some suck dramatic music located at the bottom of this crystal clear jungle river there is a large water filled crate inside the crate is a key that will unlock the teams next snake clue the team must use the provided tools to pull the crate from the river and undo the chain securing it if the team can get the key untie and unlock the chest in minutes or less theyll win their final snake clue the challenge starts now listen this is what i think we ought to do i guess apparently its gonna be under that tree thats giving us a clue its right there someone has to go on the tree somebody needs to start getting that rope and stuff to the tree and start trying to rig it up yeah im gonna go see what we got and then ima come back and im gonna start telling you what we need yeah can you swim good yeah all right hey i definitely think we should have partners to start off we dont i dont think we need two people in the water we have to remember somebody in our group is a snake so me and you are going in the water i only need one person in the water so why dont you want me to go with you why dont you want the help because we need the muscle in the tree i know you guys dont trust me but let me tell you guys something this is my element all right im telling you i got to get this why do you want to be the like the huge hero when its a whole team effort im not gonna be a hero all i want to do is go down there and see where it is right im gonna go with you in the water thats what were gonna do all right whatever these two are gonna go into the tree im gonna give you the help all right one could have been opening that box right there though well get it done theres four of us so whatever i know you dont trust me but whatever definitely not x jumps in and decides that he should go into the water he was insistent so i said hey we just got to get going go for it he did not need to be in the water this is my destiny this was always my vision let me show you how im livin this moment that was written here over here you got it babe yeah okay what oh my god oh god it looks like i sabotaged the challenge this is exactly what the snake would do dramatic music it looks like i sabotaged the challenge this looks really bad wait why isnt that dropping now i thought you were supposed to oh my god why isnt it dropping the hook we need the hook whats the reason why i feel what im feelin oh jesus christ pull it back up tell me whats the reason why im dealing with these demons okay how about we go down do you want to start going down there yeah oh bleep why is it so heavy connected the guys are working on the box in the water the women are working on the box on the land theyre trying to untangle this thing so if they get the key they can put it in the box tell me whats the reason why im dealing with these demons theres like hella dirt hey guys grab that rope dont can you not can you not accuse him and just focus xavier was acting like the snake we lost the trunk i knew he didnt need to be in the water could have been up there straightening that shackle out so that could be snakey stop yelling at him and communicate thats not helping yeah go up there and get extra eyes over there and let me know when to pull just yell bleep ten minutes remaining okay its behind you xavier its like right behind you tense music yes lets go come on bleep ten minutes left guys okay okay he is doing the most right now yeah hand me the end of it look at him what are you doing one two three pull pull pull hold on what are you doing tell us what youre doing communicate what are you doing what are you doing pull oh jesus come on pull it pull it you aint telling us nothing damn so right now the way wyatt is barking orders and trying to command the whole situation being so alpha and so demanding determined to prove that he is not the snake is not necessarily sitting well with me come on wyatts acting a little sus to me can we pull it with the rope yes now get this off watch yourself watch yourself four hands working on the chain at the same time got it another end sam there you go i dont want to hear it one minute left down goes elektra yeah careful its gonna happen get it get it get it get it overlapping chatter whoo nice job all cheering yeah all that lets go yeah bobby nice job you guys have the key congratulations yes lets go lets go im gonna open the box and were gonna pull out the third and final snake clue whoo its gonna mean something good work guys here we go the third clue is as follows with pom poms and spirit the snake cheered in a gym dramatic music but when in a group wont go out on a limb xavier you looked at the two ladies why im not a cheerleader it just said pom poms and gym yeah i was like im not a cheerleader either i dont think g i joe is a cheerleader thank you youre welcome i bet you im not a good cheerleader anyway i was throwing some mad shade with that side eye but they said pom poms in a gym and i was like oh i was like thats sam the challenge may be over but the game definitely is not over the most intense part of this game is yet to happen because thats at the snake pit you have your watches grab your stuff your gps will get you back to camp good job team good job guys all right get it with the pom poms being thrown in sam looks suspicious because sam literally told me last night shes a cheerleader pom poms cheerleading i mean its not quantum physics weapons are stowed the battle is over man no more of that yes sir well move on now we got to start planning for the pit right yeah the snake pit i am nervous for the snake pit im not gonna lie with that last clue suspicions are rising with me i was a cheerleader so my strategy moving forward is to really connect with elektra get her on my side let her know that im not lying cause at this point i can see why they think it would be me but im not the snake it comes down to just talking and trusting each other yes tense music im not the snake it just looks it looks so bad i swear it is not me i really do appreciate our conversations and like i really hope that you trust me i dont know i really dont think its you i know like i dont want to think its you either and i dont but at this point everyone is just like so good at lying okay im gonna say this very quietly could be xavier hes in la a lot of modeling a lot of acting that goes with cosplay xavier is really athletic he is in great shape and he currently is in college right now so maybe he is you know a male cheerleader elektra her being like very very religious but then like has a really foul mouth bleep yeah well for a church girl you got a mouth on you i know right bleep come on come on come on oh this is hot bleep were gonna have to come to a complete collaboration exactly ominous music welcome to the snake pit it is here that we will go over everything that you have been through as we figure out together who the snake is let me remind you guys at the end of this three of you will have to agree who the snake is because if three of you agree and youre right the team will split if three of you agree and youre wrong the snake will get all the money and the team gets nothing if youre not the snake itll be your job to convince your teammates that you are not the snake so the game is still happening right now in the snake pit you know every word in these clues have a meaning as to who the snake is in over the last two days did anything catch your attention um id have to say it was probably after the second clue and what did the clue say while travelling abroad is a part of their past the snake hates the outdoors where they dirty too fast we previously talked about where have you been where have you traveled and both wyatt and i just said that we have been out of the country so of course when we read it i was like that could be either of us i was in the military so i got to travel all over the world it it points to me and him so yeah what about the line doesnt like to get dirty some people are really aware about cleanliness who our friends in the middle here i think like yeah im clean i like to be clean and fresh so an indicator too that made me think it might be her was the third clue with pom poms and spirit the snake cheered in a gym but when in a group wont go out on a limb what did you think that meant at the time it meant a lot man im not gonna lie hearing that third clue it messed me up so the night before me and sam we were just literally just talking and she had mentioned that she was a cheerleader the second you said pom poms when i tell you i literally felt my heart fall i was just like no xavier im watching your expression youre looking around at your teammates mm hmm whered your mind go it had to be the same as elektra after that third clue after she had already told us shes a cheerleader and just stuff like that im gonna have to say i think that its sam hopefully my teammates feel the same way elektra i really want to hone in with you because i know that weve been really good friends this whole time and i just really really hope that you take to heart what we talked about elektra im looking at you youre struggling suspenseful music the evidence is not helping yeah its bec like i like groans i like obviously have like a deep connection with sam like she literally looked me in my eyes and shes like its not me its not me so like i still mean that it is still girl code all the way dude dont go based off of emotion you gotta go based off of what you saw and go with your feeling that you have already yeah and your feeling of course shes gonna plead her case but also of course go off of your feeling thats a fight no its not i think it is xavier little things that he was like i wanna take a shower i want to get clean and then i know my girl elektra she camps up in new york wyatt you do search and rescue so like i know youre not afraid to get your hands dirty its time to vote you guys were literally about to lose elektra really think about this dude i swear on everything on my like everything dude it is not me you guys were literally about to lose elektra really think about this dude i swear on everything on my like everything dude i swear it is not me tense music its time to vote up first wyatt youll take your piece and youll turn it front facing to the person that you think is the snake next up elektra xavier youre next no hard feelings final vote sam its now time to see who you guys think is the snake first vote sam second vote sam third vote xavier two votes sam one vote xavier and the fourth and final vote sam so you guys obviously all think its sam if sam is the snake you three will share if sam is not the snake and one of you three are you just won all the money the question is will the real snake please stand up gasps laughs elektra congratulations lets talk about this what was your strategy deny deny deny the only thing i could think of to deflect liking cosplay is make it about religion i am very connected to the church and i dont partake in the dressing up to cartoon characters for cosplay people are kind of touchy about the subject you never want to offend someone elses religion oh nice the choir is like my home thats whats up no ones gonna challenge a black womans belief on religion they have a better chance of meeting beyonc so are you into church like are you heavily into no not at all not even a little bit okay wait you really sold us thats why i was believing it the second clue im immediately saying this is my first time out of the country this is actually my second time in costa rica oh its your second time even here yeah the first time i went with my family as for the third clue with pom poms and spirit the snake cheered in a gym sam mentioned that she was a cheerleader the second she said that i was just like oh okay shes a cheerleader too and initially normally the first thing i do when someone mentions something that i obviously have in common you relate with them oh yeah me too but i didnt say me too i was like oh thats cool thats cool challenge wise you werent gonna sabotage i wasnt gonna sabotage like there was no way elektra had like a foul mouth for a church girl but other than that she really had me fooled like she really did that so she did a great job im just im shocked that it was her i didnt want to think it was her were pulling this girl code stuff i think all boys are snakes so wheres the lie cant find one in british accent come on over milady i feel like if you can make people laugh you can make them feel comfortable enough to not think that its you i feel horrible are you kidding me shes the sweetest girl ever you could just take me out later for a shopping spree like i want to visit her in nashville like shes such a good vibe when everyone turned against me it hurt i totally got played elektra did the whole girl code girl power i let my guard down and i found out that i am really loyal to a fault my biggest takeaway from this crazy experience is yes you can be a very trusting and loyal person but its always good to keep your guard up and to put yourself first you played a heck of a game brilliant you shouldnt feel guilty when you know its a game you play hard and you worry about feelings later and also sometimes the most dangerous snakes are one you never suspect no the snake struck and the snake won good good job dude thank you thats respect you earned it thats a respectful clap right there karma could possibly come back and get me for using religion as an advantage point to win but i mean i have to pay for medical bills so im not too worried about it i feel like a super genius yeah you did that i mean bleep \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

letters mm and other items like oh an opera program and a lace handkerchief a and a photograph of her ladyship mementos you might say they must have meant a lot to captain hammond kept them locked in a tin box he did along with his decorations how come you uh you got hold of them then hmm oh i was his batman you see ah like brothers we were fighting side by side with the afridis coming at us through the khyber pass yelling their heathen cries im proud to say i polished off the one that got the captain got him you mean this uh this captain hammond is uh hes dead is he a knife straight through the liver exhales sharply oh he never suffered i think i think her ladyship would like to know that now hang on a minute now when when an officer dies they they send his stuff home dont they i i mean to his relatives i mean uh true that is the usual practice yes how the hell do you come to get them well you see like i uh i felt that i still had a duty towards the deceased oh yeah yeah now the captain often used to talk to me about his wedded sister living in cheltenham oh very fond of her he was very fond and i was afraid that shed got enough of a shock as it was hearing about the captains death you know without discovering from the letters that he had been canoodling with a married woman and her the wife of a tory m p at that do you follow me look you know what you should have done with those letters dont you burnt them to ashes the lot of them well it occurred to me that her ladyship might prefer to have them back yeah yeah women can be very sentimental about such things you know yeah well look i uh i tell you what mr dooley you give me those letters and ill make sure she gets them back all right uh no no no i dont think thatd be very proper no i tell you what you have a word with her ladyship and uh tell her the circumstances and arrange for her to receive me huh scoffs and if theres any question of a reward ill see you right now i cant say fairer than that now can i a reward what sort of uh reward were you thinking of you all right in the top story are you no letters are worth these ones are and theyre for sale only do you know what i think mr dooley what i think you made all this up make what up all this about captain hammond now you just stay where you are taffy and ill show you a sample of my wares there theres one see and i have a whole bundle

to you who her ladyship mm never well why else did she give that rise last month well for my uh outstanding presentability and all round skill thats roughly what i thought do you know it reminds me a bit of ada liversedge ada liversedge mm she was on the bill with me at the oxton empire monologues and refined juggling lovely act proper lady muck she was butter wouldnt melt well one night we come in early and we found her in the pipe room with the theater fireman it was the uniform you see all them buttons so you better watch out my boy chuckles yeah well you dont have to worry sarah you do what you like its no skin off my nose i cant see a lady of quality losing her head over one of her own servants oh they do sometimes so ive heard tell quite grand ladies have you ever heard tell of lady marjorie going off the rails how should i know oh its just that i thought you knew most of what went on in this house thats all what you being so helpful all of a sudden for eh sarah oh its just an excuse to come and talk to you really rose it seems goodness knows how long since we had a chat not much to chat about anymore you got your life i got mine rose well its true i dont know how to i dont know where i am with you no more sometimes i think i was better off in the old days when you and me used to share that room together do you remember we used to lie awake at night and talk about all the things we was gonna do yeah well you did one or two of them didnt you yes oh well it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all whats that supposed to mean i daresay you got that much out of all that memories rose memories oh yeah well i wasnt cut out for the humdrum bonds of marriage do you see me washing some fellas socks and wiping his childrens runny noses no i cant not now you mention it but just cause you dont fancy it dont mean to say its not a good idea oh youd like it wouldnt you yes i would only i dont seem to get no offers give us your hand what for come on i might be able to see well youve got nothing to worry about have you see its all there clear as daylight see all them little lines yeah what are they children rose mm yes one a year till oh poo if the first ones a girl will you call her sarah after me course i will you can be godmother if you like i would the nearest ill ever get to having one of me own dont say that im sure youll find somebody thought i had captain james oh sarah you didnt really think i did rose really oh i know hes a bit of a philanderer but i thought hed settle down like his father now thats what i call an ideal marriage years of wedded bliss them two upstairs and bet in all that time shes never looked at another fella what makes you so sure well shes not the type is she looks can lie sometimes what do you mean rose well between you me and the gatepost lady marjories had her little moments only its not to go beyond these four walls little moments lady marjorie do you mean another gentleman mm it must have been when you was away you could almost say she cast her bonnet over a windmill who with rose well go on tell me you swear you wont breathe a word to a living soul i cross my heart now tell well he was in the army same as captain james a couple of years older maybe blue eyes ever so romantic looking younger than her ladyship of course well captain james brought him to the house one evening her ladyship took one look at him and she was done for chuckles it sounds like one of them magazine stories that mrs bridges says is only fit for scullery maids be that as it may miss roberts always said they fell in love at the opera soft music dimming lights mm did the master know course not silly but we all did belowstairs see this captain hammond he was on leave from india and hed taken rooms in ebury street she used to go there in the afternoon mrs bridges saw her she saw her coming out all felled and mysterious looking so we knew something was up he used to send her flowers every day with bits of poetry attached and she used to write him billet doux how do you know um well the blotter in her boudoir we used to hold it up against the mirror you could see the writing ever so clearly how long ago was all this about three years and uh how did how did it end then well this captain hammond went back to india and got killed in action uh mr hudson read about it in the paper rose said they was all dreadfully upset downstairs when he read it out and she said lady marjorie went around looking all pale and sad so that was that nothing to show for her romance but a few fading memories all gone all forgotten not a lock of hair a photograph or even a packet of love letters thats what rose said shame isnt it watkins why are we stopping here i beg your pardon my lady but ive got something most important to say to you surely you can wait i tell you i must get to the jewelers or they wont what on earth do you think youre doing im sorry my lady but uh theres no other way of speaking to you in private you see theres an individual irish i think trying to wheedle some money out of you what do you mean watkins a tradesman of some kind uh no my lady um an old soldier that thats what he says he saw service in india so he says im sure you had a most interesting conversation but i dont want to hear about it now will you please take me to the jewelers as i asked you my lady this man has in his possession some letters letters written by your good self i understand t they are signed so the man claims by your ladyship and and coming from eaton place and to whom does he say they are written these letters to someone by the name of captain hammond my lady well i hardly think that my correspondence with captain hammond would be of interest to anyone he was merely an acquaintance of my sons who came to the house on various occasions oh yes yes i see my lady marjorie i seem to remember reading that he was killed on active service uh yeah thats right my lady uh uh this man dooley was with him when he died dooley a brother officer of captain hammonds no he was the he was the captains batman my lady i see that thats how hed come to be in possession of the letters see and you say this batman is asking for money in exchange for the letters uh yes yes my lady i uh i i thought i ought to make the position clear i hope you dont you dont mind me mentioning it my lady no you did quite right watkins tell me did any of the other servants see this man uh no no my lady uh mr hudson shut the door in his face without asking what he wanted and uh he came round to the mews to try and make himself agreeable to me yes i see watkins i think it might be as well if you didnt mention him to anyone very good my lady i suppose its simply that he he expects some sort of reward in return for lost property thats right my lady thats a great deal of money yes thats thats what i told him my lady when will you be seeing him again well hes hes coming back later this evening would you like to speak to him yourself my lady uh no no i dont think thatll be necessary as you seem to have involved yourself in all this well that was no choice of mine my lady the question is how to raise such a large sum of money in so short a time shall i drive you to the bank my lady no no i i dont want to go to my bank um watkins a are there not establishments where its possible to raise a loan on the security of some possession marjorie you can leave that here watkins ill get hudson to have it sent up later very good my lady oh and i shant need the car again today thank you thomas very good my lady richard there you are my dear psst what happened she was pretty shaken i can tell you turned quite pale she did yeah i told you it was true rose wouldnt make up a thing like that she had to pop a necklace so the master wouldnt find out i got the money how much never you mind teas ready belowstairs ill have to uh have to put the car away oh hang on a minute give us a kiss not in here later thank you rose marjorie you look worried my dear oh im sorry anything the matter no not really i was just thinking about various things james james well wondering whether his regiment might be in action one day i worry about him things are quiet on the northwest frontier at the moment thats good theres been no trouble out there since the fighting with the afridis last year when they had a number of casualties in the um the khyber rifles thats all right then knock on door who is it its me dooley thomas come upstairs its more private and mind your head michael no thanks had a word with her ladyship have you uh yes yes i have i bet it was quite a shock for her the poor soul discovering that her little indiscretion had come to light thought shed got away with it huh no i dont think she thought that what do you mean well it it wasnt such a dark and guilty secret as you imagined see well it ought to be a married woman carrying on like that and her in high society aye well i dont think they pay a great deal of attention to that sort of thing in high society i mean not nowadays well they damn well ought to mm are you telling me that her misbehavior was common knowledge oh no no but i uh i uh i think she made a clean breast of it so i hear to her husband your letters wont tell him anything he doesnt know already huh yeah im sorry mr dooley you seem to have been under a misapprehension yeah those those letters are a lot of useless rubbish man oh i wouldnt be too sure about that now listen she uh she did say shed give you a fiver for them scoffs shed like the photograph see now thats only in the way of charity man upper crust indeed i wouldnt give you twopence for the lot of them mm aye well never mind the twopence mr dooley do you want a fiver or not fiver huh come to think of it maybe there is such a thing as a public duty public duty mm maybe the public has a right to know the way their betters behave themselves in the privacy of their wealthy homes well i dont think its any of their business mr dooley i mean not not the ordinary commoner and who elected mr richard bellamy into parliament will you tell me that the ordinary honest working man thats who put him up there in westminster yeah well i think theyre mostly bank clerks in beckenham mr dooley yeah well maybe they are but are they going to vote for a man who upholds immorality oh no my lad ill soon put a stop to that youll see no i d i dont see mr dooley now what are you gonna do about it stand on street corners giving the letters to anyone passing by is it not at all no there are those who put these facts into print for all to see lord northcliffe to name but one now theres a man with a strong sense of public duty and its just the stuff for the daily mail you think so do you i do and ill tell you something else ill get myself a tidy sum for them letters when i offer them to a newspaper a newspaper oh well thats thats different isnt it tis taffy isnt it its different now yeah well i tell you what ill ill give you the on behalf of her ladyship well you lying welsh bastard oh yeah im sure we can do better than now taffy shell never pay well then youll only have to go to your master wont you after all he is a member of parliament he wont want this sort of stuff to be going into the newspapers now will he quid taffy thats my price hudson you did quite right to inform me mr watkins well i i felt it was my my duty mr hudson chuckles those letters are undoubtedly forgeries i could tell that the man who came round to your mews after id shown him the door was nothing more than a common impostor someone whod obviously taken the trouble to look up the family in debretts peerage oh oh yes yes i see mr hudson and to make up some cock and bull story about her ladyship and and some army officer called oh whatever it was captain hammond quite london is full of such people mr watkins confidence tricksters no less well i im only pleased that theres no truth in in what this man dooley says mr hudson you can put the matter right out of your head thomas well thank you thank you very much mr hudson now get on with your work door opens uh mr watkins but hudson youve been in this house long enough to know that theres nothing involving her ladyship that even lord northcliffe could turn into a scandal oh nothing at all sir i just felt that youd wish to be informed about this mans absurd claims thats right hes probably got hold of letters written by her ladyship to to some relative quite so sir affectionate but entirely innocent im sure youre right sir on the other hand sir one gathers that the wording of the letters renders them open to some uh misrepresentation im sure it does the most harmless correspondence can be twisted in some way people are always ready to believe the worst thats very true sir do you know to whom my wife is supposed to have addressed these letters i dont think theres anything to be gained by repeating slander sir no i see that all the same presumably the innuendo is that her ladyship has had an illicit liaison of some kind i cant get the light to it unless i know who the fellows meant to be you do see my point oh quite sir wheres watkins now ive asked him to wait outside in the hall sir send him in very good sir door opens uh mr watkins footsteps approach oh come in watkins uh hudson tells me a man has approached you in the mews with some proposition or other uh yes sir i uh i hope you dont think i did wrong to mention it sir oh no no no you were absolutely right im glad to see you have the same spirit of responsibility as the other servants in this house all right hudson i beg your pardon sir i feel i ought to remain since mr watkins i take your point hudson but i dont need you thatll be all very good sir door closes richard in the ordinary way id have no compunction in handing this man over to the police uh but since my wifes honor is being challenged i intend to proceed more delicately you understand what i mean dont you yes sir i do not intend to allow my wife to be in any way upset no oh no sir you havent of course said anything to her about this man well how how could you think id do a thing like that sir quite well since youve shown such excellent discretion so far may i rely on your discretion a little further naturally sir when you see this man again i want you to find out exactly what he wants well ive already done that sir did mr hudson not tell you he merely informed me that a man claiming to possess certain letters signed by her ladyship had called round at the garage hudson is under the impression the man is a harmless impostor quite frankly id rather leave hudson with that impression quite sir how much is this man asking for the letters ah thats a great deal of money sir well if its a question of keeping her ladyship in ignorance of such a distasteful affair id gladly pay times as much well im glad to hear you say that sir now if i uh do negotiate with this man will he keep his side of the bargain you leave that to me sir ill make sure that he does very well watkins i hereby instruct you to buy back those letters whatever they may contain without her ladyships knowledge as man to man can i trust you you can sir thank you watkins michael uh is it all right if i come in door closes have you spoken to his nibs no no i havent the price is now taffy and dont you forget it your price has been agreed oh i thought so her ladyship has decided to pay all of it after all whats a couple of hundred quid to such a wealthy woman a drop in the ocean innit it laughs well come on come on lets see the color of your money oh now just a minute mr dooley now you you wouldnt expect my mistress a lady of quality to trust me with in bank notes would you i mean me a chauffeur a simple servant no i wouldnt trust you with a babys rattle meself her ladyship wishes to receive the letters from you personally oh does she indeed she also would like to hand over the money to you herself i i am merely the go between look ill not wait much longer now im warning you you wont have to mr dooley the transaction can take place tonight where well therell have to be a secret meeting place wont there in the park maybe now you wouldnt expect my mistress to wait under a tree in hyde park would you no no i mean somebody might come by and recognize her isnt it so ill ill come to her room will i you come to the garage here tonight at now ill leave that small door open for you and then what well ill be driving her ladyship home tonight about or thereabouts now with her permission ill drive straight into the garage and if i close those big doors you can conduct your business in the back of the car and nobody will disturb you see you know taffy i like that idea chuckles i like it very much in the back of the rolls tonight me and lady marjorie huh chuckles ill be here taffy ill be here hoofbeats vehicle approaches all right in the back of the car please mr dooley private michael dooley my lady may i wish you the compliments of the season my lady in the car please its very kind of your ladyship to receive me personally in your motorcar there was little alternative since i am not accustomed to receiving common soldiers in my drawing room well i may be a common soldier my lady but i have to earn a living times are very hard you know indistinct talking seven years serving his majesty and not even a gratuity so you resort to blackmail well theres no need to be insulting a woman in your position shouldnt behave like that its not right dont you want common people to respect you not particularly mr dooley oh yeah well i cant sit here all night arguing are you going to pay up or arent you first i must be sure if you are who you pretend to be show me your discharge papers i i dont carry them around with me then youre not like any old solider i ever heard of wilkins can we trust this fellow well thats thats up to you my lady how do i know that you were a friend of captain hammonds i was his batman wasnt i were you i dont know well i can prove it he had a mole on his left cheek now youd remember that ah yes poor charles and his mole i remember once i i beg your pardon my lady but i i think we ought to be getting on with the transaction now not until ive told mr dooley exactly what i think of him are you not ashamed to batten upon the frailty of a woman you scoundrel who you talking to sarah stinking blather the uh the transaction my lady yes yes yes quite right wilkins uh let us conduct this affair in a civilized fashion i apologize offer mr dooley some refreshment very good my lady come here man now you can drink to her ladyships health and the conclusion of our successful negotiations oh ill do that thanks ahh now you may give me my letters may you not mr dooley oh with pleasure me lady there can you remember them ah yes immediately the sight of them upsets me now ill ill take the money

during what folks in these parts call the storm of the century but i was wrong i only started learning during the big blow i finished just last week advertise your product or brand here contact today i grew up in maine but in a way i never really lived in maine i think anyone from my part of the world would say the same folks from little tall send their taxes to augusta same as other folks and we

acting a little sus to me helicopter whirring when the sun is shining bright i have no idea what im doing out here it looks treacherous its so exciting my bloods just cooking im ready to get on it im former military i was trained to seek and destroy and then on the other hand i also have training as a medic i could cut your throat but then i could also fix it cant keep me down i stand my ground i describe myself as like multi dimensional athletic sociable extroverted im very calm in a game situation honestly i think the type of person that comes out here is a crazy person so i gotta be a little loco you know cant stop now hey hey i have no idea what im getting myself into but i love adventure and i like taking risks and my personality can range from puppy dogs and rainbows to i will cut you cant stop now oh my god thats terrifying i am someone thats rather impulsive i love a good competition because i have a big mouth i like to talk a lot of smack i am not here to please everyone im just here to be authentic and who i am and if they like it great and if they dont everyone cant have great taste hey hey im disappointed in the team thats been handed to me theres an age gap where i could put two of them together and they dont even equal my age but i dont think im gonna have a problem as long as theyll listen to me cant stop now ominous music you must be thinking to yourself what have i gotten myself into what do you think is about to happen i have absolutely no idea first let me introduce myself im bobby bones i will be your guide through what were about to go through youre gonna work as a team but heres the thing that gets a little crazy there is a snake amongst you four dramatic music someone is trying to sabotage the group because if they do theyre going to win isnt it crazy that one of you right now is lying i am not the snake im not the snake i am not the snake im not the snake there are a couple of challenges if youre able to successfully complete a challenge you will open this box right here inside the box is the snake clue that gets you one step closer to finding out who the snake is if you dont pass the challenge that clue disappears forever im gonna have to work with these teammates to accomplish a task but now one of them is gonna try to stop that that is worst case scenario in any mission after the two challenges well meet at the snake pit where you will decide whos the snake i have no idea whos the snake the most important thing is figuring out who the snake is thats where the money is right now youre at your first challenge location and here are the rules located feet above this treacherous canyon there are snake flags the team must use a zip line to grab four snake flags and match them with snake images located on the answer board players may grab one flag at a time and they must avoid the decoys and duplicates on the line if the team can successfully match the four correct flags in minutes or less they will win the first snake clue lets gear up okay so i feel like we should start communicating my strategy is to get people to word vomit i feel like the more people talk they tell on them themselves well yeah lets go ahead and do intro all right uh my name is xavier um im from san francisco but im a college student in los angeles uh and im a student athlete i run track and field and im a model out there too id say im an excellent judge of character im very intuitive i get feelings about people you know so i think i think itll be a no brainer to figure out who it is im elektra i have not done anything like this before so what do you do so i do advertising for a church oh did you say where you were from im from upstate new york what about you guys im wyatt im from florida im married and i have a beautiful daughter who just started college oh wow oh yeah so im former military oh wow so you know what youre doing im also a stuntman wow nice as well as currently a volunteer helicopter rescue swimmer okay oh wow this is totally your element yeah this is your element for sure i just beat cancer so i kind of look at this at being as a chance to prove myself that im not down and out and if i win this money im gonna use it to pay for my daughters college so that she doesnt have to work so she can focus on her studies so my name is sam im from reno nevada but i live in nashville right now but i am a proud dog mom my strategy is to get everyone to trust me people view me as a genuine nice person i like to listen so people confide in me a lot im thinking that i should go first cause id probably get back quicker and then youll go and then shell go third and then sam perfect i am a little bit nervous just because i dont know what to expect we barely know each other but our reward for this challenge is the snake clue the four of us have to work together as a team we have to get this clue all right here we go ready set go all right come on wyatt lets go lets go lets go if you drop a flag youre a snake dramatic music g i joe lets go laughs come on boy all right wyatt come on wyatt ah its too high come on wyatt oh no oh no good no good he did not get a flag oh my god come on there is money on the line this is no joke we are trying to get this coin big swing and a miss for wyatt there theres like a dupe in our group theres a snake its wyatt at this moment in my mind dramatic music it looked bad and if i were my team members i would think it would be me as well i dont know tense music he missed them all no flag god dang it ten minutes remaining i look like the damn snake it is so important for us to successfully win this challenge because we need this clue that will ultimately help us find out who is the snake i think i think so im the friggin snake because i flubbed it up a little bit try to get the first second or third cause i think those are all three that we need we gonna push it to the limit about to set that tone let the name be known come on xavier that looked a smidge intentional im the shaker the mover eliminate the confusion you can do it i dont talk it i do it yes yes lets go whoo yes yes yes yes yes hey lets go snake match i dont feel secure holding it like this oh god oh my god bleep elektra is off and running dramatic music bleep missed the first one elektra coming through for her team getting that flag right there oh my god thats terrifying oh do i have a flag bleep yes oh my god elektra is very fake very very theatrical in everything shes doing a little over a little too much thats hard as bleep drew a suspicion immediately good job that was terrifying ah get it match lets go sam purple or orange just reach okay here we go here we go here we go lets go sam lets go get it get it yeah whoo lets go yeah lets go hold on she better hold on you better not drop it whoo sam saw the flag sam got the flag nice job sam come on sam stop snaking she aint snaking she got us orange baby lets go lets go panting all right all right

touch the first one bro no the second one its all good he get it yeah he got the first one but im pretty sure thats one we already had grunts wyatts got a flag but were not sure which one that is i got one wyatt brought up the wrong snake one flag to go girl mm hmm elektra and i are stepping up and that in my mind tells me that i can trust her automatically i think all boys are snakes wheres the lie cant find one five minutes left guys you gotta hurry xavier come on you can do it its right in your path need the purple one you can do it grab it its the purple one whoo hoo hoo lets go all right

orion thats wild what are the odds that yall have twins in the family xavier and elektra have twins in their family thats kind of thats a rare thing so that was kind of interesting to hear something like that oh my gosh its so pretty this is nice not too shabby this is interesting whats over there everybodys already looking for a clue line of ants right here i see little holes im worried about an actual snake oh xavier is this another clue what you guys got back there another clue bust it open bust it open go for it yeah you know what lets not open it yet why why not cause we need to talk man and get some intel before we open it up and find another dead end thats true thats true so save it you want to put it back there lets get to know each other a bit right away wyatt takes charge again and im thinking maybe hes trying to control the game tense music all right team looking like a fire hey we eating tonight i got my marshmallow stick what g i joe lets go blow it out before it goes out thank you so much make a wish whoo did that make you feel home enough man or what yeah it did thank you so much i usually never celebrate my birthday without my twin brother so its like hella weird aw

dakota he has a football scholarship so he plays football out there gee thats whats up yeah wait you both play football no i run track do they know that i was a cheerleader you better come on five six seven eight wait you were a cheerleader thats so cool yeah yep all throughout high school lets start chatting man well hey lets go tell us about you your hobbies cosplay laughter you can try again um i am very connected to the church and i dont partake in the dressing up to cartoon characters for cosplay um i am a baptist woman and we do not play about that the only time i dress up is on sundays tuesdays and thursdays when i am praising almighty so do you sing yes in the choir nice aw something that stood out to me elektra was very religious oh do i have a flag bleep yes oh my god oh my finger bleep bleep but i think shes pretty foulmouthed and im kind of suspicious of that what made you want to come do this honestly stepping out of my comfort zone you know what i mean like i love never ever before anything i do hiking upstate what else can you tell us about you mr interrogation yeah were going damn youre over here like running up on what about yall im an open book you guys can ask me anything im studying nutrition right now nice i try to pick up on clues if someone is lying or telling the truth by how they present themselves and if theyre making eye contact or not my job is just modelling in la i do like content creation and stuff like cosplay no definitely not content creator like the content creator stuff its like on tiktok like for haircare brands and stuff and like for clothes and all that oh xavier is kind of like an influencer so hes really good at getting people to like him he knows how to gain followers and he knows how to put that face on what else yeah we dont know nothing about sam im sorry what about sam sams starting to get snaked out here sam is one that i cant figure out because shes not giving me any tells she is kind of withdrawn that puts a target on her um okay so im sam i have a cute little dog i moved out of my hometown which was a really big step for me but im happy i did it being a single kid is kind of tough huh no i have a little sister shes back home so what sam is the most exciting thing youve ever done in your life you know i went to thailand on a volunteer trip by myself oh wow thats amazing it was so amazing whats the craziest thing youve ever done former military did the navy for eight years the coast guard for six so youve traveled all over huh yeah good for you how many brothers and sisters do you have i have a half brother and i have a stepbrother so thats technically not your biological siblings it said the snake has no siblings i feel like all of us are just kind of looking at each other like okay i dont know man thats a huge red flag should we do our clue while traveling abroad is a part of their past the snake hates the outdoors where they dirty too fast all right huh that is juicy you guys what were you saying again about how many where youve been ive been out of the country a handful of times ive been to laos ive been to mexico ive been in canada wow nice i mean the clues are only clues were gonna have to see how people perform lets remember peoples performances today in the first challenge dude im sorry about that performance today man and you said you havent been out of the country yeah this is my first time and your first time yeah this is my first time too who do you think it might be i feel like its too early to say we havent even done this ah we can get a gut feel i got a i got a suspicion okay im gonna im gonna put my cards on the table and im aiming at you sam chuckles yeah im gonna put my cards on the table and im aiming at you sam why do you think that cause ive been out of the country thats the only other reason i mean on the paper you know people can lie about it i know i know thats true but im just saying apparently i will be transparent i feel like its you oh god i wish i was wait what wait did you just admit it im gonna keep telling you that im not and im gonna tell you that i wish i was we dont want you to tell us we want you to show us in these challenges but i feel like thats what the snake would say though like i wish you know what i mean i think everyone looks a little guilty yeah at this point in the game i can see reasons why everyone could be it whens the last time you went to cosplay i dont i dont cosplay does anyone know someone who does cosplay mm mm right i know sam why you keep pressing her though wyatt is deflecting and calling sam a snake trying to project that onto her its a little suspicious i know g i joe be at the renaissance fairs they dont play with guns in those things you think i want to go in one of those things and play with plastic weapons but youre a man of many trades youve told us a bunch of stuff youre a damn stunt double youve done been to war so i dont put it past you at this point my approach is defending from my experience hard hard hard is a kind of a sign of guilt i think im good so if you guys dont mind i think ima go ahead and brush my teeth and all right this was very constructive you guys it was gives me lots to think about oh my god that is a lot of ants yeah oh no oh my god guys sam screams lets get our bedding ready in fact im gonna make me a damn hammock in the tree with that little sleeping bag i think bro is that a bleep tarantula no no no no no no hell no bleep sam screaming oh hell no no no no not on my watch not on my watch hes like coiling up hes ready to pounce i dont want to seem antisocial but im gonna go to bed soon would a snake kind of only fend for themselves in a sense i love my hammocks thats snake behavior to me in british accent come on over milady get comfy im scared did homey go to sleep grasshopper mer her do you see it laughs you are doing some amanda bynes references and i am digging it dude i used to love amanda bynes the amanda show was my bleep so good so good i would say i do form friendships and bonds quickly i like eggs are you kidding i like eggs iconic and sometimes i will assess that person and see how i can relate to them any way possible i think the bond that im forming with sam is effortless and natural like i just watched shes the man thank you oh my god thats one of my favorite movies im stoked to have someone on my side and i think that we together can find out who the snake is what the bleep is that what a scorpion bro where scorpion oh my bleep god well looks like im not bleep falling asleep now that bleep was huge im not going to sleep dont leave a dragon in the woods your mind is searching ever should if you tie a dragon to a tree i kinda wanna wash my face tense music is this your water yeah i noticed that xavier is really aware about his cleanliness at least i can wash my face and put some deodorant on and then the second clue said that this person doesnt like to get dirty xavier is on my radar again are we all ready all right guys i got the coordinates on the watch looks like were going that way which is north so lets go embrace some suck dramatic music located at the bottom of this crystal clear jungle river there is a large water filled crate inside the crate is a key that will unlock the teams next snake clue the team must use the provided tools to pull the crate from the river and undo the chain securing it if the team can get the key untie and unlock the chest in minutes or less theyll win their final snake clue the challenge starts now listen this is what i think we ought to do i guess apparently its gonna be under that tree thats giving us a clue its right there someone has to go on the tree somebody needs to start getting that rope and stuff to the tree and start trying to rig it up yeah im gonna go see what we got and then ima come back and im gonna start telling you what we need yeah can you swim good yeah all right hey i definitely think we should have partners to start off we dont i dont think we need two people in the water we have to remember somebody in our group is a snake so me and you are going in the water i only need one person in the water so why dont you want me to go with you why dont you want the help because we need the muscle in the tree i know you guys dont trust me but let me tell you guys something this is my element all right im telling you i got to get this why do you want to be the like the huge hero when its a whole team effort im not gonna be a hero all i want to do is go down there and see where it is right im gonna go with you in the water thats what were gonna do all right whatever these two are gonna go into the tree im gonna give you the help all right one could have been opening that box right there though well get it done theres four of us so whatever i know you dont trust me but whatever definitely not x jumps in and decides that he should go into the water he was insistent so i said hey we just got to get going go for it he did not need to be in the water this is my destiny this was always my vision let me show you how im livin this moment that was written here over here you got it babe yeah okay what oh my god oh god it looks like i sabotaged the challenge this is exactly what the snake would do dramatic music it looks like i sabotaged the challenge this looks really bad wait why isnt that dropping now i thought you were supposed to oh my god why isnt it dropping the hook we need the hook whats the reason why i feel what im feelin oh jesus christ pull it back up tell me whats the reason why im dealing with these demons okay how about we go down do you want to start going down there yeah oh bleep why is it so heavy connected the guys are working on the box in the water the women are working on the box on the land theyre trying to untangle this thing so if they get the key they can put it in the box tell me whats the reason why im dealing with these demons theres like hella dirt hey guys grab that rope dont can you not can you not accuse him and just focus xavier was acting like the snake we lost the trunk i knew he didnt need to be in the water could have been up there straightening that shackle out so that could be snakey stop yelling at him and communicate thats not helping yeah go up there and get extra eyes over there and let me know when to pull just yell bleep ten minutes remaining okay its behind you xavier its like right behind you tense music yes lets go come on bleep ten minutes left guys okay okay he is doing the most right now yeah hand me the end of it look at him what are you doing one two three pull pull pull hold on what are you doing tell us what youre doing communicate what are you doing what are you doing pull oh jesus come on pull it pull it you aint telling us nothing damn so right now the way wyatt is barking orders and trying to command the whole situation being so alpha and so demanding determined to prove that he is not the snake is not necessarily sitting well with me come on wyatts acting a little sus to me can we pull it with the rope yes now get this off watch yourself watch yourself four hands working on the chain at the same time got it another end sam there you go i dont want to hear it one minute left down goes elektra yeah careful its gonna happen get it get it get it get it overlapping chatter whoo nice job all cheering yeah all that lets go yeah bobby nice job you guys have the key congratulations yes lets go lets go im gonna open the box and were gonna pull out the third and final snake clue whoo its gonna mean something good work guys here we go the third clue is as follows with pom poms and spirit the snake cheered in a gym dramatic music but when in a group wont go out on a limb xavier you looked at the two ladies why im not a cheerleader it just said pom poms and gym yeah i was like im not a cheerleader either i dont think g i joe is a cheerleader thank you youre welcome i bet you im not a good cheerleader anyway i was throwing some mad shade with that side eye but they said pom poms in a gym and i was like oh i was like thats sam the challenge may be over but the game definitely is not over the most intense part of this game is yet to happen because thats at the snake pit you have your watches grab your stuff your gps will get you back to camp good job team good job guys all right get it with the pom poms being thrown in sam looks suspicious because sam literally told me last night shes a cheerleader pom poms cheerleading i mean its not quantum physics weapons are stowed the battle is over man no more of that yes sir well move on now we got to start planning for the pit right yeah the snake pit i am nervous for the snake pit im not gonna lie with that last clue suspicions are rising with me i was a cheerleader so my strategy moving forward is to really connect with elektra get her on my side let her know that im not lying cause at this point i can see why they think it would be me but im not the snake it comes down to just talking and trusting each other yes tense music im not the snake it just looks it looks so bad i swear it is not me i really do appreciate our conversations and like i really hope that you trust me i dont know i really dont think its you i know like i dont want to think its you either and i dont but at this point everyone is just like so good at lying okay im gonna say this very quietly could be xavier hes in la a lot of modeling a lot of acting that goes with cosplay xavier is really athletic he is in great shape and he currently is in college right now so maybe he is you know a male cheerleader elektra her being like very very religious but then like has a really foul mouth bleep yeah well for a church girl you got a mouth on you i know right bleep come on come on come on oh this is hot bleep were gonna have to come to a complete collaboration exactly ominous music welcome to the snake pit it is here that we will go over everything that you have been through as we figure out together who the snake is let me remind you guys at the end of this three of you will have to agree who the snake is because if three of you agree and youre right the team will split if three of you agree and youre wrong the snake will get all the money and the team gets nothing if youre not the snake itll be your job to convince your teammates that you are not the snake so the game is still happening right now in the snake pit you know every word in these clues have a meaning as to who the snake is in over the last two days did anything catch your attention um id have to say it was probably after the second clue and what did the clue say while travelling abroad is a part of their past the snake hates the outdoors where they dirty too fast we previously talked about where have you been where have you traveled and both wyatt and i just said that we have been out of the country so of course when we read it i was like that could be either of us i was in the military so i got to travel all over the world it it points to me and him so yeah what about the line doesnt like to get dirty some people are really aware about cleanliness who our friends in the middle here i think like yeah im clean i like to be clean and fresh so an indicator too that made me think it might be her was the third clue with pom poms and spirit the snake cheered in a gym but when in a group wont go out on a limb what did you think that meant at the time it meant a lot man im not gonna lie hearing that third clue it messed me up so the night before me and sam we were just literally just talking and she had mentioned that she was a cheerleader the second you said pom poms when i tell you i literally felt my heart fall i was just like no xavier im watching your expression youre looking around at your teammates mm hmm whered your mind go it had to be the same as elektra after that third clue after she had already told us shes a cheerleader and just stuff like that im gonna have to say i think that its sam hopefully my teammates feel the same way elektra i really want to hone in with you because i know that weve been really good friends this whole time and i just really really hope that you take to heart what we talked about elektra im looking at you youre struggling suspenseful music the evidence is not helping yeah its bec like i like groans i like obviously have like a deep connection with sam like she literally looked me in my eyes and shes like its not me its not me so like i still mean that it is still girl code all the way dude dont go based off of emotion you gotta go based off of what you saw and go with your feeling that you have already yeah and your feeling of course shes gonna plead her case but also of course go off of your feeling thats a fight no its not i think it is xavier little things that he was like i wanna take a shower i want to get clean and then i know my girl elektra she camps up in new york wyatt you do search and rescue so like i know youre not afraid to get your hands dirty its time to vote you guys were literally about to lose elektra really think about this dude i swear on everything on my like everything dude it is not me you guys were literally about to lose elektra really think about this dude i swear on everything on my like everything dude i swear it is not me tense music its time to vote up first wyatt youll take your piece and youll turn it front facing to the person that you think is the snake next up elektra xavier youre next no hard feelings final vote sam its now time to see who you guys think is the snake first vote sam second vote sam third vote xavier two votes sam one vote xavier and the fourth and final vote sam so you guys obviously all think its sam if sam is the snake you three will share if sam is not the snake and one of you three are you just won all the money the question is will the real snake please stand up gasps laughs elektra congratulations lets talk about this what was your strategy deny deny deny the only thing i could think of to deflect liking cosplay is make it about religion i am very connected to the church and i dont partake in the dressing up to cartoon characters for cosplay people are kind of touchy about the subject you never want to offend someone elses religion oh nice the choir is like my home thats whats up no ones gonna challenge a black womans belief on religion they have a better chance of meeting beyonc so are you into church like are you heavily into no not at all not even a little bit okay wait you really sold us thats why i was believing it the second clue im immediately saying this is my first time out of the country this is actually my second time in costa rica oh its your second time even here yeah the first time i went with my family as for the third clue with pom poms and spirit the snake cheered in a gym sam mentioned that she was a cheerleader the second she said that i was just like oh okay shes a cheerleader too and initially normally the first thing i do when someone mentions something that i obviously have in common you relate with them oh yeah me too but i didnt say me too i was like oh thats cool thats cool challenge wise you werent gonna sabotage i wasnt gonna sabotage like there was no way elektra had like a foul mouth for a church girl but other than that she really had me fooled like she really did that so she did a great job im just im shocked that it was her i didnt want to think it was her were pulling this girl code stuff i think all boys are snakes so wheres the lie cant find one in british accent come on over milady i feel like if you can make people laugh you can make them feel comfortable enough to not think that its you i feel horrible are you kidding me shes the sweetest girl ever you could just take me out later for a shopping spree like i want to visit her in nashville like shes such a good vibe when everyone turned against me it hurt i totally got played elektra did the whole girl code girl power i let my guard down and i found out that i am really loyal to a fault my biggest takeaway from this crazy experience is yes you can be a very trusting and loyal person but its always good to keep your guard up and to put yourself first you played a heck of a game brilliant you shouldnt feel guilty when you know its a game you play hard and you worry about feelings later and also sometimes the most dangerous snakes are one you never suspect no the snake struck and the snake won good good job dude thank you thats respect you earned it thats a respectful clap right there karma could possibly come back and get me for using religion as an advantage point to win but i mean i have to pay for medical bills so im not too worried about it i feel like a super genius yeah you did that i mean bleep \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

letters mm and other items like oh an opera program and a lace handkerchief a and a photograph of her ladyship mementos you might say they must have meant a lot to captain hammond kept them locked in a tin box he did along with his decorations how come you uh you got hold of them then hmm oh i was his batman you see ah like brothers we were fighting side by side with the afridis coming at us through the khyber pass yelling their heathen cries im proud to say i polished off the one that got the captain got him you mean this uh this captain hammond is uh hes dead is he a knife straight through the liver exhales sharply oh he never suffered i think i think her ladyship would like to know that now hang on a minute now when when an officer dies they they send his stuff home dont they i i mean to his relatives i mean uh true that is the usual practice yes how the hell do you come to get them well you see like i uh i felt that i still had a duty towards the deceased oh yeah yeah now the captain often used to talk to me about his wedded sister living in cheltenham oh very fond of her he was very fond and i was afraid that shed got enough of a shock as it was hearing about the captains death you know without discovering from the letters that he had been canoodling with a married woman and her the wife of a tory m p at that do you follow me look you know what you should have done with those letters dont you burnt them to ashes the lot of them well it occurred to me that her ladyship might prefer to have them back yeah yeah women can be very sentimental about such things you know yeah well look i uh i tell you what mr dooley you give me those letters and ill make sure she gets them back all right uh no no no i dont think thatd be very proper no i tell you what you have a word with her ladyship and uh tell her the circumstances and arrange for her to receive me huh scoffs and if theres any question of a reward ill see you right now i cant say fairer than that now can i a reward what sort of uh reward were you thinking of you all right in the top story are you no letters are worth these ones are and theyre for sale only do you know what i think mr dooley what i think you made all this up make what up all this about captain hammond now you just stay where you are taffy and ill show you a sample of my wares there theres one see and i have a whole bundle tucked away sarah singing in distance yeah well ill tell you what ill uh ill find out what i can and uh you you come back later tonight okay all right sir right yeah uh good morning miss its a grand day thank god sarah yes whos that thomas oh he just he just popped in to have a look at the car thats all you uh you thought any more about spending your day off with me have you might if her ladyship can spare you well whats that supposed to mean well i wonder if shed go out driving quite so often if her chauffeur was years old with curly teeth the rest of the staff think shes taken quite a shine to you who her ladyship mm never well why else did she give that rise last month well for my uh outstanding presentability and all round skill thats roughly what i thought do you know it reminds me a bit of ada liversedge ada liversedge mm she was on the bill with me at the oxton empire monologues and refined juggling lovely act proper lady muck she was butter wouldnt melt well one night we come in early and we found her in the pipe room with the theater fireman it was the uniform you see all them buttons so you better watch out my boy chuckles yeah well you dont have to worry sarah you do what you like its no skin off my nose i cant see a lady of quality losing her head over one of her own servants oh they do sometimes so ive heard tell quite grand ladies have you ever heard tell of lady marjorie going off the rails how should i know oh its just that i thought you knew most of what went on in this house thats all what you being so helpful all of a sudden for eh sarah oh its just an excuse to come and talk to you really rose it seems goodness knows how long since we had a chat not much to chat about anymore you got your life i got mine rose well its true i dont know how to i dont know where i am with you no more sometimes i think i was better off in the old days when you and me used to share that room together do you remember we used to lie awake at night and talk about all the things we was gonna do yeah well you did one or two of them didnt you yes oh well it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all whats that supposed to mean i daresay you got that much out of all that memories rose memories oh yeah well i wasnt cut out for the humdrum bonds of marriage do you see me washing some fellas socks and wiping his childrens runny noses no i cant not now you mention it but just cause you dont fancy it dont mean to say its not a good idea oh youd like it wouldnt you yes i would only i dont seem to get no offers give us your hand what for come on i might be able to see well youve got nothing to worry about have you see its all there clear as daylight see all them little lines yeah what are they children rose mm yes one a year till oh poo if the first ones a girl will you call her sarah after me course i will you can be godmother if you like i would the nearest ill ever get to having one of me own dont say that im sure youll find somebody thought i had captain james oh sarah you didnt really think i did rose really oh i know hes a bit of a philanderer but i thought hed settle down like his father now thats what i call an ideal marriage years of wedded bliss them two upstairs and bet in all that time shes never looked at another fella what makes you so sure well shes not the type is she looks can lie sometimes what do you mean rose well between you me and the gatepost lady marjories had her little moments only its not to go beyond these four walls little moments lady marjorie do you mean another gentleman mm it must have been when you was away you could almost say she cast her bonnet over a windmill who with rose well go on tell me you swear you wont breathe a word to a living soul i cross my heart now tell well he was in the army same as captain james a couple of years older maybe blue eyes ever so romantic looking younger than her ladyship of course well captain james brought him to the house one evening her ladyship took one look at him and she was done for chuckles it sounds like one of them magazine stories that mrs bridges says is only fit for scullery maids be that as it may miss roberts always said they fell in love at the opera soft music dimming lights mm did the master know course not silly but we all did belowstairs see this captain hammond he was on leave from india and hed taken rooms in ebury street she used to go there in the afternoon mrs bridges saw her she saw her coming out all felled and mysterious looking so we knew something was up he used to send her flowers every day with bits of poetry attached and she used to write him billet doux how do you know um well the blotter in her boudoir we used to hold it up against the mirror you could see the writing ever so clearly how long ago was all this about three years and uh how did how did it end then well this captain hammond went back to india and got killed in action uh mr hudson read about it in the paper rose said they was all dreadfully upset downstairs when he read it out and she said lady marjorie went around looking all pale and sad so that was that nothing to show for her romance but a few fading memories all gone all forgotten not a lock of hair a photograph or even a packet of love letters thats what rose said shame isnt it watkins why are we stopping here i beg your pardon my lady but ive got something most important to say to you surely you can wait i tell you i must get to the jewelers or they wont what on earth do you think youre doing im sorry my lady but uh theres no other way of speaking to you in private you see theres an individual irish i think trying to wheedle some money out of you what do you mean watkins a tradesman of some kind uh no my lady um an old soldier that thats what he says he saw service in india so he says im sure you had a most interesting conversation but i dont want to hear about it now will you please take me to the jewelers as i asked you my lady this man has in his possession some letters letters written by your good self i understand t they are signed so the man claims by your ladyship and and coming from eaton place and to whom does he say they are written these letters to someone by the name of captain hammond my lady well i hardly think that my correspondence with captain hammond would be of interest to anyone he was merely an acquaintance of my sons who came to the house on various occasions oh yes yes i see my lady marjorie i seem to remember reading that he was killed on active service uh yeah thats right my lady uh uh this man dooley was with him when he died dooley a brother officer of captain hammonds no he was the he was the captains batman my lady i see that thats how hed come to be in possession of the letters see and you say this batman is asking for money in exchange for the letters uh yes yes my lady i uh i i thought i ought to make the position clear i hope you dont you dont mind me mentioning it my lady no you did quite right watkins tell me did any of the other servants see this man uh no no my lady uh mr hudson shut the door in his face without asking what he wanted and uh he came round to the mews to try and make himself agreeable to me yes i see watkins i think it might be as well if you didnt mention him to anyone very good my lady i suppose its simply that he he expects some sort of reward in return for lost property thats right my lady thats a great deal of money yes thats thats what i told him my lady when will you be seeing him again well hes hes coming back later this evening would you like to speak to him yourself my lady uh no no i dont think thatll be necessary as you seem to have involved yourself in all this well that was no choice of mine my lady the question is how to raise such a large sum of money in so short a time shall i drive you to the bank my lady no no i i dont want to go to my bank um watkins a are there not establishments where its possible to raise a loan on the security of some possession marjorie you can leave that here watkins ill get hudson to have it sent up later very good my lady oh and i shant need the car again today thank you thomas very good my lady richard there you are my dear psst what happened she was pretty shaken i can tell you turned quite pale she did yeah i told you it was true rose wouldnt make up a thing like that she had to pop a necklace so the master wouldnt find out i got the money how much never you mind teas ready belowstairs ill have to uh have to put the car away oh hang on a minute give us a kiss not in here later thank you rose marjorie you look worried my dear oh im sorry anything the matter no not really i was just thinking about various things james james well wondering whether his regiment might be in action one day i worry about him things are quiet on the northwest frontier at the moment thats good theres been no trouble out there since the fighting with the afridis last year when they had a number of casualties in the um the khyber rifles thats all right then knock on door who is it its me dooley thomas come upstairs its more private and mind your head michael no thanks had a word with her ladyship have you uh yes yes i have i bet it was quite a shock for her the poor soul discovering that her little indiscretion had come to light thought shed got away with it huh no i dont think she thought that what do you mean well it it wasnt such a dark and guilty secret as you imagined see well it ought to be a married woman carrying on like that and her in high society aye well i dont think they pay a great deal of attention to that sort of thing in high society i mean not nowadays well they damn well ought to mm are you telling me that her misbehavior was common knowledge oh no no but i uh i uh i think she made a clean breast of it so i hear to her husband your letters wont tell him anything he doesnt know already huh yeah im sorry mr dooley you seem to have been under a misapprehension yeah those those letters are a lot of useless rubbish man oh i wouldnt be too sure about that now listen she uh she did say shed give you a fiver for them scoffs shed like the photograph see now thats only in the way of charity man upper crust indeed i wouldnt give you twopence for the lot of them mm aye well never mind the twopence mr dooley do you want a fiver or not fiver huh come to think of it maybe there is such a thing as a public duty public duty mm maybe the public has a right to know the way their betters behave themselves in the privacy of their wealthy homes well i dont think its any of their business mr dooley i mean not not the ordinary commoner and who elected mr richard bellamy into parliament will you tell me that the ordinary honest working man thats who put him up there in westminster yeah well i think theyre mostly bank clerks in beckenham mr dooley yeah well maybe they are but are they going to vote for a man who upholds immorality oh no my lad ill soon put a stop to that youll see no i d i dont see mr dooley now what are you gonna do about it stand on street corners giving the letters to anyone passing by is it not at all no there are those who put these facts into print for all to see lord northcliffe to name but one now theres a man with a strong sense of public duty and its just the stuff for the daily mail you think so do you i do and ill tell you something else ill get myself a tidy sum for them letters when i offer them to a newspaper a newspaper oh well thats thats different isnt it tis taffy isnt it its different now yeah well i tell you what ill ill give you the on behalf of her ladyship well you lying welsh bastard oh yeah im sure we can do better than now taffy shell never pay well then youll only have to go to your master wont you after all he is a member of parliament he wont want this sort of stuff to be going into the newspapers now will he quid taffy thats my price hudson you did quite right to inform me mr watkins well i i felt it was my my duty mr hudson chuckles those letters are undoubtedly forgeries i could tell that the man who came round to your mews after id shown him the door was nothing more than a common impostor someone whod obviously taken the trouble to look up the family in debretts peerage oh oh yes yes i see mr hudson and to make up some cock and bull story about her ladyship and and some army officer called oh whatever it was captain hammond quite london is full of such people mr watkins confidence tricksters no less well i im only pleased that theres no truth in in what this man dooley says mr hudson you can put the matter right out of your head thomas well thank you thank you very much mr hudson now get on with your work door opens uh mr watkins but hudson youve been in this house long enough to know that theres nothing involving her ladyship that even lord northcliffe could turn into a scandal oh nothing at all sir i just felt that youd wish to be informed about this mans absurd claims thats right hes probably got hold of letters written by her ladyship to to some relative quite so sir affectionate but entirely innocent im sure youre right sir on the other hand sir one gathers that the wording of the letters renders them open to some uh misrepresentation im sure it does the most harmless correspondence can be twisted in some way people are always ready to believe the worst thats very true sir do you know to whom my wife is supposed to have addressed these letters i dont think theres anything to be gained by repeating slander sir no i see that all the same presumably the innuendo is that her ladyship has had an illicit liaison of some kind i cant get the light to it unless i know who the fellows meant to be you do see my point oh quite sir wheres watkins now ive asked him to wait outside in the hall sir send him in very good sir door opens uh mr watkins footsteps approach oh come in watkins uh hudson tells me a man has approached you in the mews with some proposition or other uh yes sir i uh i hope you dont think i did wrong to mention it sir oh no no no you were absolutely right im glad to see you have the same spirit of responsibility as the other servants in this house all right hudson i beg your pardon sir i feel i ought to remain since mr watkins i take your point hudson but i dont need you thatll be all very good sir door closes richard in the ordinary way id have no compunction in handing this man over to the police uh but since my wifes honor is being challenged i intend to proceed more delicately you understand what i mean dont you yes sir i do not intend to allow my wife to be in any way upset no oh no sir you havent of course said anything to her about this man well how how could you think id do a thing like that sir quite well since youve shown such excellent discretion so far may i rely on your discretion a little further naturally sir when you see this man again i want you to find out exactly what he wants well ive already done that sir did mr hudson not tell you he merely informed me that a man claiming to possess certain letters signed by her ladyship had called round at the garage hudson is under the impression the man is a harmless impostor quite frankly id rather leave hudson with that impression quite sir how much is this man asking for the letters ah thats a great deal of money sir well if its a question of keeping her ladyship in ignorance of such a distasteful affair id gladly pay times as much well im glad to hear you say that sir now if i uh do negotiate with this man will he keep his side of the bargain you leave that to me sir ill make sure that he does very well watkins i hereby instruct you to buy back those letters whatever they may contain without her ladyships knowledge as man to man can i trust you you can sir thank you watkins michael uh is it all right if i come in door closes have you spoken to his nibs no no i havent the price is now taffy and dont you forget it your price has been agreed oh i thought so her ladyship has decided to pay all of it after all whats a couple of hundred quid to such a wealthy woman a drop in the ocean innit it laughs well come on come on lets see the color of your money oh now just a minute mr dooley now you you wouldnt expect my mistress a lady of quality to trust me with in bank notes would you i mean me a chauffeur a simple servant no i wouldnt trust you with a babys rattle meself her ladyship wishes to receive the letters from you personally oh does she indeed she also would like to hand over the money to you herself i i am merely the go between look ill not wait much longer now im warning you you wont have to mr dooley the transaction can take place tonight where well therell have to be a secret meeting place wont there in the park maybe now you wouldnt expect my mistress to wait under a tree in hyde park would you no no i mean somebody might come by and recognize her isnt it so ill ill come to her room will i you come to the garage here tonight at now ill leave that small door open for you and then what well ill be driving her ladyship home tonight about or thereabouts now with her permission ill drive straight into the garage and if i close those big doors you can conduct your business in the back of the car and nobody will disturb you see you know taffy i like that idea chuckles i like it very much in the back of the rolls tonight me and lady marjorie huh chuckles ill be here taffy ill be here hoofbeats vehicle approaches all right in the back of the car please mr dooley private michael dooley my lady may i wish you the compliments of the season my lady in the car please its very kind of your ladyship to receive me personally in your motorcar there was little alternative since i am not accustomed to receiving common soldiers in my drawing room well i may be a common soldier my lady but i have to earn a living times are very hard you know indistinct talking seven years serving his majesty and not even a gratuity so you resort to blackmail well theres no need to be insulting a woman in your position shouldnt behave like that its not right dont you want common people to respect you not particularly mr dooley oh yeah well i cant sit here all night arguing are you going to pay up or arent you first i must be sure if you are who you pretend to be show me your discharge papers i i dont carry them around with me then youre not like any old solider i ever heard of wilkins can we trust this fellow well thats thats up to you my lady how do i know that you were a friend of captain hammonds i was his batman wasnt i were you i dont know well i can prove it he had a mole on his left cheek now youd remember that ah yes poor charles and his mole i remember once i i beg your pardon my lady but i i think we ought to be getting on with the transaction now not until ive told mr dooley exactly what i think of him are you not ashamed to batten upon the frailty of a woman you scoundrel who you talking to sarah stinking blather the uh the transaction my lady yes yes yes quite right wilkins uh let us conduct this affair in a civilized fashion i apologize offer mr dooley some refreshment very good my lady come here man now you can drink to her ladyships health and the conclusion of our successful negotiations oh ill do

a rhodes scholar i dont have much in the way of philosophy either but i know one thing in this world you have to pay as you go sometimes all you have thats a lesson i thought i learned nine years ago during what folks in these parts call the storm of the century but i was wrong i only started learning during the big blow i finished just last week advertise your product or brand here contact today i grew up in maine but in a way i never really lived in maine i think anyone from my part of the world would say the same folks from little tall send their taxes to augusta same as other folks and we

one for the pot good luck better double it weatherman says its coming seen them come in every winter they howl in they howl out july always comes still they say this ones gonna be something special

dear but folks in the new england ar two to three days youre apt to be getting a whole winters worth of snow we sometimes overuse the phrase storm of the century but if these storm tracks converge as

isnt it crazy that one of you right now is lying i am not the snake im not the snake i am not the snake im not the snake there are a couple of challenges if youre able to successfully complete a challenge you will open this box right here inside the box is the snake clue that gets you one step closer to finding out who the snake is if you dont pass the challenge that clue disappears forever im gonna have to work with these teammates to accomplish a task but now one of them is gonna try to stop that that is worst case scenario in any mission after the two challenges well meet at the snake pit where you will decide whos the snake i have no idea whos the snake the most important thing is figuring out who the snake is thats where the money is right now youre at your first challenge location and here are the rules located feet above this treacherous canyon there are snake flags the team must use a zip line to grab four snake flags and match them with snake images located on the answer board players may grab one flag at a time and they must avoid the decoys and duplicates on the line if the team can successfully match the four correct flags in minutes or less they will win the first snake clue lets gear up okay so i feel like we should start communicating my strategy is to get people to word vomit i feel like the more people talk they tell on them themselves well yeah lets go ahead and do intro all right uh my name is xavier um im from san francisco but im a college student in los angeles uh and im a student athlete i run track and field and im a model out there too id say im an excellent judge of character im very intuitive i get feelings about people you know so i think i think itll be a no brainer to figure out who it is im elektra i have not done anything like this before so what do you do so i do advertising for a church oh did you say where you were from im from upstate new york what about you guys im wyatt im from florida im married and i have a beautiful daughter who just started college oh wow oh yeah so im former military oh wow so you know what youre doing im also a stuntman wow nice as well as currently a volunteer helicopter rescue swimmer okay oh wow this is totally your element yeah this is your element for sure i just beat cancer so i kind of look at this at being as a chance to prove myself that im not down and out and if i win this money im gonna use it to pay for my daughters college so that she doesnt have to work so she can focus on her studies so my name is sam im from reno nevada but i live in nashville right now but i am a proud dog mom my strategy is to get everyone to trust me people view me as a genuine nice person i like to listen so people confide in me a lot im thinking that i should go first cause id probably get back quicker and then youll go and then shell go third and then sam perfect i am a little bit nervous just because i dont know what to expect we barely know each other but our reward for this challenge is the snake clue the four of us have to work together as a team we have to get this clue all right here we go ready set go all right come on wyatt lets go lets go lets go if you drop a flag youre a snake dramatic music g i joe lets go laughs come on boy all right wyatt come on wyatt ah its too high come on wyatt oh no oh no good no good he did not get a flag oh my god come on there is money on the line this is no joke we are trying to get this coin big swing and a miss for wyatt there theres like a dupe in our group theres a snake its wyatt at this moment in my mind dramatic music it looked bad and if i were my team members i would think it would be me as well i dont know tense music he missed them all no flag god dang it ten minutes remaining i look like the damn snake it is so important for us to successfully win this challenge because we need this clue that will ultimately help us find out who is the snake i think i think so im the friggin snake because i flubbed it up a little bit try to get the first second or third cause i think those are all three that we need we gonna push it to the limit about to set that tone let the name be known come on xavier that looked a smidge intentional im the shaker the mover eliminate the confusion you can do it i dont talk it i do it yes yes lets go whoo yes yes yes yes yes hey lets go snake match i dont feel secure holding it like this oh god oh my god bleep elektra is off and running dramatic music bleep missed the first one elektra coming through for her team getting that flag right there oh my god thats terrifying oh do i have a flag bleep yes oh my god elektra is very fake very very theatrical in everything shes doing a little over a little too much thats hard as bleep drew a suspicion immediately good job that was terrifying ah get it match lets go sam purple or orange just reach okay here we go here we go here we go lets go sam lets go get it get it yeah whoo lets go yeah lets go hold on she better hold on you better not drop it whoo sam saw the flag sam got the flag nice job sam come on sam stop snaking she aint snaking she got us orange baby lets go lets go panting all right all right weve got three correct flags on the board one flag to go for that snake clue which what color do we need purple thats it this is so specific but where is it though on there come on wyatt lets go dont touch the first one bro no the second one its all good he get it yeah he got the first one but im pretty sure thats one we already had grunts wyatts got a flag but were not sure which one that is i got one wyatt brought up the wrong snake one flag to go girl mm hmm elektra and i are stepping up and that in my mind tells me that i can trust her automatically i think all boys are snakes wheres the lie cant find one five minutes left guys you gotta hurry xavier come on you can do it its right in your path need the purple one you can do it grab it its the purple one whoo hoo hoo lets go all right lets go dont drop it oh my god he came through yes he came through yes sir i got purple whoo whoo lets go xavier for the snake clue its good snake clue all cheering yeah lets go im so pumped that we won the first challenge elektra and i stepped up whoo yeah yes wyatt is on my radar right now and im not sure about xavier congratulations yes thank you thank you three of you are genuinely happy right now whoo lets get it one of you is not a win for the team is great but its also a loss for the snake when i open this box their identity will be one step closer to being revealed here is your first snake clue uh huh suspenseful music this only child loves cosplay and wears many disguises beware that a snake comes in all shapes and sizes tense music i think that we had gotten that thing tomorrow man i guarantee you one you guys would have talked about being a cosplayer cause i want to know and now youre not gonna tell me all laugh all this getting to know each other is gonna happen at camp okay and thats where youre going next youre gonna head to camp and there youre gonna search for your next clue the coordinates to camp are in your watch i will see you guys tomorrow at the second challenge its in my veins now i feel it look in my eyes theres no way to conceal it nothing is written bet you cant feel it truth or im livin good job today guys we survived it now usually im scared of heights too so oh really yeah i just i didnt even think about it i was like hey its my birthday im just gonna happy birthday yeah how old are you thank you oh yes were you the firstborn actually i am the third i have an older sister a twin brother and then its me i have a twin you have a twin too yeah well im not but my younger siblings are twins oh really thats dope yeah athena and orion thats wild what are the odds that yall have twins in the family xavier and elektra have twins in their family thats kind of thats a rare thing so that was kind of interesting to hear something like that oh my gosh its so pretty this is nice not too shabby this is interesting whats over there everybodys already looking for a clue line of ants right here i see little holes im worried about an actual snake oh xavier is this another clue what you guys got back there another clue bust it open bust it open go for it yeah you know what lets not open it yet why why not cause we need to talk man and get some intel before we open it up and find another dead end thats true thats true so save it you want to put it back there lets get to know each other a bit right away wyatt takes charge again and im thinking maybe hes trying to control the game tense music all right team looking like a fire hey we eating tonight i got my marshmallow stick what g i joe lets go blow it out before it goes out thank you so much make a wish whoo did that make you feel home enough man or what yeah it did thank you so much i usually never celebrate my birthday without my twin brother so its like hella weird aw is this your first time celebrating without him yeah aw thats adorable what is he doing to celebrate hes at home with my family from college so where does he go to school he goes to a school in south dakota he has a football scholarship so he plays football out there gee thats whats up yeah wait you both play football no i run track do they know that i was a cheerleader you better come on five six seven eight wait you were a cheerleader thats so cool yeah yep all throughout high school lets start chatting man well hey lets go tell us about you your hobbies cosplay laughter you can try again um i am very connected to the church and i dont partake in the dressing up to cartoon characters for cosplay um i am a baptist woman and we do not play about that the only time i dress up is on sundays tuesdays and thursdays when i am praising almighty so do you sing yes in the choir nice aw something that stood out to me elektra was very religious oh do i have a flag bleep yes oh my god oh my finger bleep bleep but i think shes pretty foulmouthed and im kind of suspicious of that what made you want to come do this honestly stepping out of my comfort zone you know what i mean like i love never ever before anything i do hiking upstate what else can you tell us about you mr interrogation yeah were going damn youre over here like running up on what about yall im an open book you guys can ask me anything im studying nutrition right now nice i try to pick up on clues if someone is lying or telling the truth by how they present themselves and if theyre making eye contact or not my job is just modelling in la i do like content creation and stuff like cosplay no definitely not content creator like the content creator stuff its like on tiktok like for haircare brands and stuff and like for clothes and all that oh xavier is kind of like an influencer so hes really good at getting people to like him he knows how to gain followers and he knows how to put that face on what else yeah we dont know nothing about sam im sorry what about sam sams starting to get snaked out here sam is one that i cant figure out because shes not giving me any tells she is kind of withdrawn that puts a target on her um okay so im sam i have a cute little dog i moved out of my hometown which was a really big step for me but im happy i did it being a single kid is kind of tough huh no i have a little sister shes back home so what sam is the most exciting thing youve ever done in your life you know i went to thailand on a volunteer trip by myself oh wow thats amazing it was so amazing whats the craziest thing youve ever done former military did the navy for eight years the coast guard for six so youve traveled all over huh yeah good for you how many brothers and sisters do you have i have a half brother and i have a stepbrother so thats technically not your biological siblings it said the snake has no siblings i feel like all of us are just kind of looking at each other like okay i dont know man thats a huge red flag should we do our clue while traveling abroad is a part of their past the snake hates the outdoors where they dirty too fast all right huh that is juicy you guys what were you saying again about how many where youve been ive been out of the country a handful of times ive been to laos ive been to mexico ive been in canada wow nice i mean the clues are only clues were gonna have to see how people perform lets remember peoples performances today in the first challenge dude im sorry about that performance today man and you said you havent been out of the country yeah this is my first time and your first time yeah this is my first time too who do you think it might be i feel like its too early to say we havent even done this ah we can get a gut feel i got a i got a suspicion okay im gonna im gonna put my cards on the table and im aiming at you sam chuckles yeah im gonna put my cards on the table and im aiming at you sam why do you think that cause ive been out of the country thats the only other reason i mean on the paper you know people can lie about it i know i know thats true but im just saying apparently i will be transparent i feel like its you oh god i wish i was wait what wait did you just admit it im gonna keep telling you that im not and im gonna tell you that i wish i was we dont want you to tell us we want you to show us in these challenges but i feel like thats what the snake would say though like i wish you know what i mean i think everyone looks a little guilty yeah at this point in the game i can see reasons why everyone could be it whens the last time you went to cosplay i dont i dont cosplay does anyone know someone who does cosplay mm mm right i know sam why you keep pressing her though wyatt is deflecting and calling sam a snake trying to project that onto her its a little suspicious i know g i joe be at the renaissance fairs they dont play with guns in those things you think i want to go in one of those things and play with plastic weapons but youre a man of many trades youve told us a bunch of stuff youre a damn stunt double youve done been to war so i dont put it past you at this point my approach is defending from my experience hard hard hard is a kind of a sign of guilt i think im good so if you guys dont mind i think ima go ahead and brush my teeth and all right this was very constructive you guys it was gives me lots to think about oh my god that is a lot of ants yeah oh no oh my god guys sam screams lets get our bedding ready in fact im gonna make me a damn hammock in the tree with that little sleeping bag i think bro is that a bleep tarantula no no no no no no hell no bleep sam screaming oh hell no no no no not on my watch not on my watch hes like coiling up hes ready to pounce i dont want to seem antisocial but im gonna go to bed soon would a snake kind of only fend for themselves in a sense i love my hammocks thats snake behavior to me in british accent come on over milady get comfy im scared did homey go to sleep grasshopper mer her do you see it laughs you are doing some amanda bynes references and i am digging it dude i used to love amanda bynes the amanda show was my bleep so good so good i would say i do form friendships and bonds quickly i like eggs are you kidding i like eggs iconic and sometimes i will assess that person and see how i can relate to them any way possible i think the bond that im forming with sam is effortless and natural like i just watched shes the man thank you oh my god thats one of my favorite movies im stoked to have someone on my side and i think that we together can find out who the snake is what the bleep is that what a scorpion bro where scorpion oh my bleep god well looks like im not bleep falling asleep now that bleep was huge im not going to sleep dont leave a dragon in the woods your mind is searching ever should if you tie a dragon to a tree i kinda wanna wash my face tense music is this your water yeah i noticed that xavier is really aware about his cleanliness at least i can wash my face and put some deodorant on and then the second clue said that this person doesnt like to get dirty xavier is on my radar again are we all ready all right guys i got the coordinates on the watch looks like were going that way which is north so lets go embrace some suck dramatic music located at the bottom of this crystal clear jungle river there is a large water filled crate inside the crate is a key that will unlock the teams next snake clue the team must use the provided tools to pull the crate from the river and undo the chain securing it if the team can get the key untie and unlock the chest in minutes or less theyll win their final snake clue the challenge starts now listen this is what i think we ought to do i guess apparently its gonna be under that tree thats giving us a clue its right there someone has to go on the tree somebody needs to start getting that rope and stuff to the tree and start trying to rig it up yeah im gonna go see what we got and then ima come back and im gonna start telling you what we need yeah can you swim good yeah all right hey i definitely think we should have partners to start off we dont i dont think we need two people in the water we have to remember somebody in our group is a snake so me and you are going in the water i only need one person in the water so why dont you want me to go with you why dont you want the help because we need the muscle in the tree i know you guys dont trust me but let me tell you guys something this is my element all right im telling you i got to get this why do you want to be the like the huge hero when its a whole team effort im not gonna be a hero all i want to do is go down there and see where it is right im gonna go with you in the water thats what were gonna do all right whatever these two are gonna go into the tree im gonna give you the help all right one could have been opening that box right there though well get it done theres four of us so whatever i know you dont trust me but whatever definitely not x jumps in and decides that he should go into the water he was insistent so i said hey we just got to get going go for it he did not need to be in the water this is my destiny this was always my vision let me show you how im livin this moment that was written here over here you got it babe yeah okay what oh my god oh god it looks like i sabotaged the challenge this is exactly what the snake would do dramatic music it looks like i sabotaged the challenge this looks really bad wait why isnt that dropping now i thought you were supposed to oh my god why isnt it dropping the hook we need the hook whats the reason why i feel what im feelin oh jesus christ pull it back up tell me whats the reason why im dealing with these demons okay how about we go down do you want to start going down there yeah oh bleep why is it so heavy connected the guys are working on the box in the water the women are working on the box on the land theyre trying to untangle this thing so if they get the key they can put it in the box tell me whats the reason why im dealing with these demons theres like hella dirt hey guys grab that rope dont can you not can you not accuse him and just focus xavier was acting like the snake we lost the trunk i knew he didnt need to be in the water could have been up there straightening that shackle out so that could be snakey stop yelling at him and communicate thats not helping yeah go up there and get extra eyes over there and let me know when to pull just yell bleep ten minutes remaining okay its behind you xavier its like right behind you tense music yes lets go come on bleep ten minutes left guys okay okay he is doing the most right now yeah hand me the end of it look at him what are you doing one two three pull pull pull hold on what are you doing tell us what youre doing communicate what are you doing what are you doing pull oh jesus come on pull it pull it you aint telling us nothing damn so right now the way wyatt is barking orders and trying to command the whole situation being so alpha and so demanding determined to prove that he is not the snake is not necessarily sitting well with me come on wyatts acting a little sus to me can we pull it with the rope yes now get this off watch yourself watch yourself four hands working on the chain at the same time got it another end sam there you go i dont want to hear it one minute left down goes elektra yeah careful its gonna happen get it get it get it get it overlapping chatter whoo nice job all cheering yeah all that lets go yeah bobby nice job you guys have the key congratulations yes lets go lets go im gonna open the box and were gonna pull out the third and final snake clue whoo its gonna mean something good work guys here we go the third clue is as follows with pom poms and spirit the snake cheered in a gym dramatic music but when in a group wont go out on a limb xavier you looked at the two ladies why im not a cheerleader it just said pom poms and gym yeah i was like im not a cheerleader either i dont think g i joe is a cheerleader thank you youre welcome i bet you im not a good cheerleader anyway i was throwing some mad shade with that side eye but they said pom poms in a gym and i was like oh i was like thats sam the challenge may be over but the game definitely is not over the most intense part of this game is yet to happen because thats at the snake pit you have your watches grab your stuff your gps will get you back to camp good job team good job guys all right get it with the pom poms being thrown in sam looks suspicious because sam literally told me last night shes a cheerleader pom poms cheerleading i mean its not quantum physics weapons are stowed the battle is over man no more of that yes sir well move on now we got to start planning for the pit right yeah the snake pit i am nervous for the snake pit im not gonna lie with that last clue suspicions are rising with me i was a cheerleader so my strategy moving forward is to really connect with elektra get her on my side let her know that im not lying cause at this point i can see why they think it would be me but im not the snake it comes down to just talking and trusting each other yes tense music im not the snake it just looks it looks so bad i swear it is not me i really do appreciate our conversations and like i really hope that you trust me i dont know i really dont think its you i know like i dont want to think its you either and i dont but at this point everyone is just like so good at lying okay im gonna say this very quietly could be xavier hes in la a lot of modeling a lot of acting that goes with cosplay xavier is really athletic he is in great shape and he currently is in college right now so maybe he is you know a male cheerleader elektra her being like very very religious but then like has a really foul mouth bleep yeah well for a church girl you got a mouth on you i know right bleep come on come on come on oh this is hot bleep were gonna have to come to a complete collaboration exactly ominous music welcome to the snake pit it is here that we will go over everything that you have been through as we figure out together who the snake is let me remind you guys at the end of this three of you will have to agree who the snake is because if three of you agree and youre right the team will split if three of you agree and youre wrong the snake will get all the money and the team gets nothing if youre not the snake itll be your job to convince your teammates that you are not the snake so the game is still happening right now in the snake pit you know every word in these clues have a meaning as to who the snake is in over the last two days did anything catch your attention um id have to say it was probably after the second clue and what did the clue say while travelling abroad is a part of their past the snake hates the outdoors where they dirty too fast we previously talked about where have you been where have you traveled and both wyatt and i just said that we have been out of the country so of course when we read it i was like that could be either of us i was in the military so i got to travel all over the world it it points to me and him so yeah what about the line doesnt like to get dirty some people are really aware about cleanliness who our friends in the middle here i think like yeah im clean i like to be clean and fresh so an indicator too that made me think it might be her was the third clue with pom poms and spirit the snake cheered in a gym but when in a group wont go out on a limb what did you think that meant at the time it meant a lot man im not gonna lie hearing that third clue it messed me up so the night before me and sam we were just literally just talking and she had mentioned that she was a cheerleader the second you said pom poms when i tell you i literally felt my heart fall i was just like no xavier im watching your expression youre looking around at your teammates mm hmm whered your mind go it had to be the same as elektra after that third clue after she had already told us shes a cheerleader and just stuff like that im gonna have to say i think that its sam hopefully my teammates feel the same way elektra i really want to hone in with you because i know that weve been really good friends this whole time and i just really really hope that you take to heart what we talked about elektra im looking at you youre struggling suspenseful music the evidence is not helping yeah its bec like i like groans i like obviously have like a deep connection with sam like she literally looked me in my eyes and shes like its not me its not me so like i still mean that it is still girl code all the way dude dont go based off of emotion you gotta go based off of what you saw and go with your feeling that you have already yeah and your feeling of course shes gonna plead her case but also of course go off of your feeling thats a fight no its not i think it is xavier little things that he was like i wanna take a shower i want to get clean and then i know my girl elektra she camps up in new york wyatt you do search and rescue so like i know youre not afraid to get your hands dirty its time to vote you guys were literally about to lose elektra really think about this dude i swear on everything on my like everything dude it is not me you guys were literally about to lose elektra really think about this dude i swear on everything on my like everything dude i swear it is not me tense music its time to vote up first wyatt youll take your piece and youll turn it front facing to the person that you think is the snake next up elektra xavier youre next no hard feelings final vote sam its now time to see who you guys think is the snake first vote sam second vote sam third vote xavier two votes sam one vote xavier and the fourth and final vote sam so you guys obviously all think its sam if sam is the snake you three will share if sam is not the snake and one of you three are you just won all the money the question is will the real snake please stand up gasps laughs elektra congratulations lets talk about this what was your strategy deny deny deny the only thing i could think of to deflect liking cosplay is make it about religion i am very connected to the church and i dont partake in the dressing up to cartoon characters for cosplay people are kind of touchy about the subject you never want to offend someone elses religion oh nice the choir is like my home thats whats up no ones gonna challenge a black womans belief on religion they have a better chance of meeting beyonc so are you into church like are you heavily into no not at all not even a little bit okay wait you really sold us thats why i was believing it the second clue im immediately saying this is my first time out of the country this is actually my second time in costa rica oh its your second time even here yeah the first time i went with my family as for the third clue with pom poms and spirit the snake cheered in a gym sam mentioned that she was a cheerleader the second she said that i was just like oh okay shes a cheerleader too and initially normally the first thing i do when someone mentions something that i obviously have in common you relate with them oh yeah me too but i didnt say me too i was like oh thats cool thats cool challenge wise you werent gonna sabotage i wasnt gonna sabotage like there was no way elektra had like a foul mouth for a church girl but other than that she really had me fooled like she really did that so she did a great job im just im shocked that it was her i didnt want to think it was her were pulling this girl code stuff i think all boys are snakes so wheres the lie cant find one in british accent come on over milady i feel like if you can make people laugh you can make them feel comfortable enough to not think that its you i feel horrible are you kidding me shes the sweetest girl ever you could just take me out later for a shopping spree like i want to visit her in nashville like shes such a good vibe when everyone turned against me it hurt i totally got played elektra did the whole girl code girl power i let my guard down and i found out that i am really loyal to a fault my biggest takeaway from this crazy experience is yes you can be a very trusting and loyal person but its always good to keep your guard up and to put yourself first you played a heck of a game brilliant you shouldnt feel guilty when you know its a game you play hard and you worry about feelings later and also sometimes the most dangerous snakes are one you never suspect no the snake struck and the snake won good good job dude thank you thats respect you earned it thats a respectful clap right there karma could possibly come back and get me for using religion as an advantage point to win but i mean i have to pay for medical bills so im not too worried about it i feel like a super genius yeah you did that i mean bleep \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

letters mm and other items like oh an opera program and a lace handkerchief a and a photograph of her ladyship mementos you might say they must have meant a lot to captain hammond kept them locked in a tin box he did along with his decorations how come you uh you got hold of them then hmm oh i was his batman you see ah like brothers we were fighting side by side with the afridis coming at us through the khyber pass yelling their heathen cries im proud to say i polished off the one that got the captain got him you mean this uh this captain hammond is uh hes dead is he a knife straight through the liver exhales sharply oh he never suffered i think i think her ladyship would like to know that now hang on a minute now when when an officer dies they they send his stuff home dont they i i mean to his relatives i mean uh true that is the usual practice yes how the hell do you come to get them well you see like i uh i felt that i still had a duty towards the deceased oh yeah yeah now the captain often used to talk to me about his wedded sister living in cheltenham oh very fond of her he was very fond and i was afraid that shed got enough of a shock as it was hearing about the captains death you know without discovering from the letters that he had been canoodling with a married woman and her the wife of a tory m p at that do you follow me look you know what you should have done with those letters dont you burnt them to ashes the lot of them well it occurred to me that her ladyship might prefer to have them back yeah yeah women can be very sentimental about such things you know yeah well look i uh i tell you what mr dooley you give me those letters and ill make sure she gets them back all right uh no no no i dont think thatd be very proper no i tell you what you have a word with her ladyship and uh tell her the circumstances and arrange for her to receive me huh scoffs and if theres any question of a reward ill see you right now i cant say fairer than that now can i a reward what sort of uh reward were you thinking of you all right in the top story are you no letters are worth these ones are and theyre for sale only do you know what i think mr dooley what i think you made all this up make what up all this about captain hammond now you just stay where you are taffy and ill show you a sample of my wares there theres one see and i have a whole bundle tucked away sarah singing in distance yeah well ill tell you what ill uh ill find out what i can and uh you you come back later tonight okay all right sir right yeah uh good morning miss its a grand day thank god sarah yes whos that thomas oh he just he just popped in to have a look at the car thats all you uh you thought any more about spending your day off with me have you might if her ladyship can spare you well whats that supposed to mean well i wonder if shed go out driving quite so often if her chauffeur was years old with curly teeth the rest of the staff think shes taken quite a shine to you who her ladyship mm never well why else did she give that rise last month well for my uh outstanding presentability and all round skill thats roughly what i thought do you know it reminds me a bit of ada liversedge ada liversedge mm she was on the bill with me at the oxton empire monologues and refined juggling lovely act proper lady muck she was butter wouldnt melt well one night we come in early and we found her in the pipe room with the theater fireman it was the uniform you see all them buttons so you better watch out my boy chuckles yeah well you dont have to worry sarah you do what you like its no skin off my nose i cant see a lady of quality losing her head over one of her own servants oh they do sometimes so ive heard tell quite grand ladies have you ever heard tell of lady marjorie going off the rails how should i know oh its just that i thought you knew most of what went on in this house thats all what you being so helpful all of a sudden for eh sarah oh its just an excuse to come and talk to you really rose it seems goodness knows how long since we had a chat not much to chat about anymore you got your life i got mine rose well its true i dont know how to i dont know where i am with you no more sometimes i think i was better off in the old days when you and me used to share that room together do you remember we used to lie awake at night and talk about all the things we was gonna do yeah well you did one or two of them didnt you yes oh well it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all whats that supposed to mean i daresay you got that much out of all that memories rose memories oh yeah well i wasnt cut out for the humdrum bonds of marriage do you see me washing some fellas socks and wiping his childrens runny noses no i cant not now you mention it but just cause you dont fancy it dont mean to say its not a good idea oh youd like it wouldnt you yes i would only i dont seem to get no offers give us your hand what for come on i might be able to see well youve got nothing to worry about have you see its all there clear as daylight see all them little lines yeah what are they children rose mm yes one a year till oh poo if the first ones a girl will you call her sarah after me course i will you can be godmother if you like i would the nearest ill ever get to having one of me own dont say that im sure youll find somebody thought i had captain james oh sarah you didnt really think i did rose really oh i know hes a bit of a philanderer but i thought hed settle down like his father now thats what i call an ideal marriage years of wedded bliss them two upstairs and bet in all that time shes never looked at another fella what makes you so sure well shes not the type is she looks can lie sometimes what do you mean rose well between you me and the gatepost lady marjories had her little moments only its not to go beyond these four walls little moments lady marjorie do you mean another gentleman mm it must have been when you was away you could almost say she cast her bonnet over a windmill who with rose well go on tell me you swear you wont breathe a word to a living soul i cross my heart now tell well he was in the army same as captain james a couple of years older maybe blue eyes ever so romantic looking younger than her ladyship of course well captain james brought him to the house one evening her ladyship took one look at him and she was done for chuckles it sounds like one of them magazine stories that mrs bridges says is only fit for scullery maids be that as it may miss roberts always said they fell in love at the opera soft music dimming lights mm did the master know course not silly but we all did belowstairs see this captain hammond he was on leave from india and hed taken rooms in ebury street she used to go there in the afternoon mrs bridges saw her she saw her coming out all felled and mysterious looking so we knew something was up he used to send her flowers every day with bits of poetry attached and she used to write him billet doux how do you know um well the blotter in her boudoir we used to hold it up against the mirror you could see the writing ever so clearly how long ago was all this about three years and uh how did how did it end then well this captain hammond went back to india and got killed in action uh mr hudson read about it in the paper rose said they was all dreadfully upset downstairs when he read it out and she said lady marjorie went around looking all pale and sad so that was that nothing to show for her romance but a few fading memories all gone all forgotten not a lock of hair a photograph or even a packet of love letters thats what rose said shame isnt it watkins why are we stopping here i beg your pardon my lady but ive got something most important to say to you surely you can wait i tell you i must get to the jewelers or they wont what on earth do you think youre doing im sorry my lady but uh theres no other way of speaking to you in private you see theres an individual irish i think trying to wheedle some money out of you what do you mean watkins a tradesman of some kind uh no my lady um an old soldier that thats what he says he saw service in india so he says im sure you had a most interesting conversation but i dont want to hear about it now will you please take me to the jewelers as i asked you my lady this man has in his possession some letters letters written by your good self i understand t they are signed so the man claims by your ladyship and and coming from eaton place and to whom does he say they are written these letters to someone by the name of captain hammond my lady well i hardly think that my correspondence with captain hammond would be of interest to anyone he was merely an acquaintance of my sons who came to the house on various occasions oh yes yes i see my lady marjorie i seem to remember reading that he was killed on active service uh yeah thats right my lady uh uh this man dooley was with him when he died dooley a brother officer of captain hammonds no he was the he was the captains batman my lady i see that thats how hed come to be in possession of the letters see and you say this batman is asking for money in exchange for the letters uh yes yes my lady i uh i i thought i ought to make the position clear i hope you dont you dont mind me mentioning it my lady no you did quite right watkins tell me did any of the other servants see this man uh no no my lady uh mr hudson shut the door in his face without asking what he wanted and uh he came round to the mews to try and make himself agreeable to me yes i see watkins i think it might be as well if you didnt mention him to anyone very good my lady i suppose its simply that he he expects some sort of reward in return for lost property thats right my lady thats a great deal of money yes thats thats what i told him my lady when will you be seeing him again well hes hes coming back later this evening would you like to speak to him yourself my lady uh no no i dont think thatll be necessary as you seem to have involved yourself in all this well that was no choice of mine my lady the question is how to raise such a large sum of money in so short a time shall i drive you to the bank my lady no no i i dont want to go to my bank um watkins a are there not establishments where its possible to raise a loan on the security of some possession marjorie you can leave that here watkins ill get hudson to have it sent up later very good my lady oh and i shant need the car again today thank you thomas very good my lady richard there you are my dear psst what happened she was pretty shaken i can tell you turned quite pale she did yeah i told you it was true rose wouldnt make up a thing like that she had to pop a necklace so the master wouldnt find out i got the money how much never you mind teas ready belowstairs ill have to uh have to put the car away oh hang on a minute give us a kiss not in here later thank you rose marjorie you look worried my dear oh im sorry anything the matter no not really i was just thinking about various things james james well wondering whether his regiment might be in action one day i worry about him things are quiet on the northwest frontier at the moment thats good theres been no trouble out there since the fighting with the afridis last year when they had a number of casualties in the um the khyber rifles thats all right then knock on door who is it its me dooley thomas come upstairs its more private and mind your head michael no thanks had a word with her ladyship have you uh yes yes i have i bet it was quite a shock for her the poor soul discovering that her little indiscretion had come to light thought shed got away with it huh no i dont think she thought that what do you mean well it it wasnt such a dark and guilty secret as you imagined see well it ought to be a married woman carrying on like that and her in high society aye well i dont think they pay a great deal of attention to that sort of thing in high society i mean not nowadays well they damn well ought to mm are you telling me that her misbehavior was common knowledge oh no no but i uh i uh i think she made a clean breast of it so i hear to her husband your letters wont tell him anything he doesnt know already huh yeah im sorry mr dooley you seem to have been under a misapprehension yeah those those letters are a lot of useless rubbish man oh i wouldnt be too sure about that now listen she uh she did say shed give you a fiver for them scoffs shed like the photograph see now thats only in the way of charity man upper crust indeed i wouldnt give you twopence for the lot of them mm aye well never mind the twopence mr dooley do you want a fiver or not fiver huh come to think of it maybe there is such a thing as a public duty public duty mm maybe the public has a right to know the way their betters behave themselves in the privacy of their wealthy homes well i dont think its any of their business mr dooley i mean not not the ordinary commoner and who elected mr richard bellamy into parliament will you tell me that the ordinary honest working man thats who put him up there in westminster yeah well i think theyre mostly bank clerks in beckenham mr dooley yeah well maybe they are but are they going to vote for a man who upholds immorality oh no my lad ill soon put a stop to that youll see no i d i dont see mr dooley now what are you gonna do about it stand on street corners giving the letters to anyone passing by is it not at all no there are those who put these facts into print for all to see lord northcliffe to name but one now theres a man with a strong sense of public duty and its just the stuff for the daily mail you think so do you i do and ill tell you something else ill get myself a tidy sum for them letters when i offer them to a newspaper a newspaper oh well thats thats different isnt it tis taffy isnt it its different now yeah well i tell you what ill ill give you the on behalf of her ladyship well you lying welsh bastard oh yeah im sure we can do better than now taffy shell never pay well then youll only have to go to your master wont you after all he is a member of parliament he wont want this sort of stuff to be going into the newspapers now will he quid taffy thats my price hudson you did quite right to inform me mr watkins well i i felt it was my my duty mr hudson chuckles those letters are undoubtedly forgeries i could tell that the man who came round to your mews after id shown him the door was nothing more than a common impostor someone whod obviously taken the trouble to look up the family in debretts peerage oh oh yes yes i see mr hudson and to make up some cock and bull story about her ladyship and and some army officer called oh whatever it was captain hammond quite london is full of such people mr watkins confidence tricksters no less well i im only pleased that theres no truth in in what this man dooley says mr hudson you can put the matter right out of your head thomas well thank you thank you very much mr hudson now get on with your work door opens uh mr watkins but hudson youve been in this house long enough to know that theres nothing involving her ladyship that even lord northcliffe could turn into a scandal oh nothing at all sir i just felt that youd wish to be informed about this mans absurd claims thats right hes probably got hold of letters written by her ladyship to to some relative quite so sir affectionate but entirely innocent im sure youre right sir on the other hand sir one gathers that the wording of the letters renders them open to some uh misrepresentation im sure it does the most harmless correspondence can be twisted in some way people are always ready to believe the worst thats very true sir do you know to whom my wife is supposed to have addressed these letters i dont think theres anything to be gained by repeating slander sir no i see that all the same presumably the innuendo is that her ladyship has had an illicit liaison of some kind i cant get the light to it unless i know who the fellows meant to be you do see my point oh quite sir wheres watkins now ive asked him to wait outside in the hall sir send him in very good sir door opens uh mr watkins footsteps approach oh come in watkins uh hudson tells me a man has approached you in the mews with some proposition or other uh yes sir i uh i hope you dont think i did wrong to mention it sir oh no no no you were absolutely right im glad to see you have the same spirit of responsibility as the other servants in this house all right hudson i beg your pardon sir i feel i ought to remain since mr watkins i take your point hudson but i dont need you thatll be all very good sir door closes richard in the ordinary way id have no compunction in handing this man over to the police uh but since my wifes honor is being challenged i intend to proceed more delicately you understand what i mean dont you yes sir i do not intend to allow my wife to be in any way upset no oh no sir you havent of course said anything to her about this man well how how could you think id do a thing like that sir quite well since youve shown such excellent discretion so far may i rely on your discretion a little further naturally sir when you see this man again i want you to find out exactly what he wants well ive already done that sir did mr hudson not tell you he merely informed me that a man claiming to possess certain letters signed by her ladyship had called round at the garage hudson is under the impression the man is a harmless impostor quite frankly id rather leave hudson with that impression quite sir how much is this man asking for the letters ah thats a great deal of money sir well if its a question of keeping her ladyship in ignorance of such a distasteful affair id gladly pay times as much well im glad to hear you say that sir now if i uh do negotiate with this man will he keep his side of the bargain you leave that to me sir ill make sure that he does very well watkins i hereby instruct you to buy back those letters whatever they may contain without her ladyships knowledge as man to man can i trust you you can sir thank you watkins michael uh is it all right if i come in door closes have you spoken to his nibs no no i havent the price is now taffy and dont you forget it your price has been agreed oh i thought so her ladyship has decided to pay all of it after all whats a couple of hundred quid to such a wealthy woman a drop in the ocean innit it laughs well come on come on lets see the color of your money oh now just a minute mr dooley now you you wouldnt expect my mistress a lady of quality to trust me with in bank notes would you i mean me a chauffeur a simple servant no i wouldnt trust you with a babys rattle meself her ladyship wishes to receive the letters from you personally oh does she indeed she also would like to hand over the money to you herself i i am merely the go between look ill not wait much longer now im warning you you wont have to mr dooley the transaction can take place tonight where well therell have to be a secret meeting place wont there in the park maybe now you wouldnt expect my mistress to wait under a tree in hyde park would you no no i mean somebody might come by and recognize her isnt it so ill ill come to her room will i you come to the garage here tonight at now ill leave that small door open for you and then what well ill be driving her ladyship home tonight about or thereabouts now with her permission ill drive straight into the garage and if i close those big doors you can conduct your business in the back of the car and nobody will disturb you see you know taffy i like that idea chuckles i like it very much in the back of the rolls tonight me and lady marjorie huh chuckles ill be here taffy ill be here hoofbeats vehicle approaches all right in the back of the car please mr dooley private michael dooley my lady may i wish you the compliments of the season my lady in the car please its very kind of your ladyship to receive me personally in your motorcar there was little alternative since i am not accustomed to receiving common soldiers in my drawing room well i may be a common soldier my lady but i have to earn a living times are very hard you know indistinct talking seven years serving his majesty and not even a gratuity so you resort to blackmail well theres no need to be insulting a woman in your position shouldnt behave like that its not right dont you want common people to respect you not particularly mr dooley oh yeah well i cant sit here all night arguing are you going to pay up or arent you first i must be sure if you are who you pretend to be show me your discharge papers i i dont carry them around with me then youre not like any old solider i ever heard of wilkins can we trust this fellow well thats thats up to you my lady how do i know that you were a friend of captain hammonds i was his batman wasnt i were you i dont know well i can prove it he had a mole on his left cheek now youd remember that ah yes poor charles and his mole i remember once i i beg your pardon my lady but i i think we ought to be getting on with the transaction now not until ive told mr dooley exactly what i think of him are you not ashamed to batten upon the frailty of a woman you scoundrel who you talking to sarah stinking blather the uh the transaction my lady yes yes yes quite right wilkins uh let us conduct this affair in a civilized fashion i apologize offer mr dooley some refreshment very good my lady come here man now you can drink to her ladyships health and the conclusion of our successful negotiations oh ill do

a rhodes scholar i dont have much in the way of philosophy either but i know one thing in this world you have to pay as you go sometimes all you have thats a lesson i thought i learned nine years ago during what folks in these parts call the storm of the century but i was wrong i only started learning during the big blow i finished just last week advertise your product or brand here contact today i grew up in maine but in a way i never really lived in maine i think anyone from my part of the world would say the same folks from little tall send their taxes to augusta same as other folks and we

one for the pot good luck better double it weatherman says its coming seen them come in every winter they howl in they howl out july always comes still they say this ones gonna be something special

dear but folks in the new england ar two to three days youre apt to be getting a whole winters worth of snow we sometimes overuse the phrase storm of the century but if these storm tracks converge as

challenge you will open this box right here inside the box is the snake clue that gets you one step closer to finding out who the snake is if you dont pass the challenge that clue disappears forever im gonna have to work with these teammates to accomplish a task but now one of them is gonna try to stop that that is worst case scenario in any mission after the two challenges well meet at the snake pit where you will decide whos the snake i have no idea whos the snake the most important thing is figuring out who the snake is thats where the money is right now youre at your first challenge location and here are the rules located feet above this treacherous canyon there are snake flags the team must use a zip line to grab four snake flags and match them with snake images located on the answer board players may grab one flag at a time and they must avoid the decoys and duplicates on the line if the team can successfully match the four correct flags in minutes or less they will win the first snake clue lets gear up okay so i feel like we should start communicating my strategy is to get people to word vomit i feel like the more people talk they tell on them themselves well yeah lets go ahead and do intro all right uh my name is xavier um im from san francisco but im a college student in los angeles uh and im a student athlete i run track and field and im a model out there too id say im an excellent judge of character im very intuitive i get feelings about people you know so i think i think itll be a no brainer to figure out who it is im elektra i have not done anything like this before so what do you do so i do advertising for a church oh did you say where you were from im from upstate new york what about you guys im wyatt im from florida im married and i have a beautiful daughter who just started college oh wow oh yeah so im former military oh wow so you know what youre doing im also a stuntman wow nice as well as currently a volunteer helicopter rescue swimmer okay oh wow this is totally your element yeah this is your element for sure i just beat cancer so i kind of look at this at being as a chance to prove myself that im not down and out and if i win this money im gonna use it to pay for my daughters college so that she doesnt have to work so she can focus on her studies so my name is sam im from reno nevada but i live in nashville right now but i am a proud dog mom my strategy is to get everyone to trust me people view me as a genuine nice person i like to listen so people confide in me a lot im thinking that i should go first cause id probably get back quicker and then youll go and then shell go third and then sam perfect i am a little bit nervous just because i dont know what to expect we barely know each other but our reward for this challenge is the snake clue the four of us have to work together as a team we have to get this clue all right here we go ready set go all right come on wyatt lets go lets go lets go if you drop a flag youre a snake dramatic music g i joe lets go laughs come on boy all right wyatt come on wyatt ah its too high come on wyatt oh no oh no good no good he did not get a flag oh my god come on there is money on the line this is no joke we are trying to get this coin big swing and a miss for wyatt there theres like a dupe in our group theres a snake its wyatt at this moment in my mind dramatic music it looked bad and if i were my team members i would think it would be me as well i dont know tense music he missed them all no flag god dang it ten minutes remaining i look like the damn snake it is so important for us to successfully win this challenge because we need this clue that will ultimately help us find out who is the snake i think i think so im the friggin snake because i flubbed it up a little bit try to get the first second or third cause i think those are all three that we need we gonna push it to the limit about to set that tone let the name be known come on xavier that looked a smidge intentional im the shaker the mover eliminate the confusion you can do it i dont talk it i do it yes yes lets go whoo yes yes yes yes yes hey lets go snake match i dont feel secure holding it like this oh god oh my god bleep elektra is off and running dramatic music bleep missed the first one elektra coming through for her team getting that flag right there oh my god thats terrifying oh do i have a flag bleep yes oh my god elektra is very fake very very theatrical in everything shes doing a little over a little too much thats hard as bleep drew a suspicion immediately good job that was terrifying ah get it match lets go sam purple or orange just reach okay here we go here we go here we go lets go sam lets go get it get it yeah whoo lets go yeah lets go hold on she better hold on you better not drop it whoo sam saw the flag sam got the flag nice job sam come on sam stop snaking she aint snaking she got us orange baby lets go lets go panting all right all right weve got three correct flags on the board one flag to go for that snake clue which what color do we need purple thats it this is so specific but where is it though on there come on wyatt lets go dont touch the first one bro no the second one its all good he get it yeah he got the first one but im pretty sure thats one we already had grunts wyatts got a flag but were not sure which one that is i got one wyatt brought up the wrong snake one flag to go girl mm hmm elektra and i are stepping up and that in my mind tells me that i can trust her automatically i think all boys are snakes wheres the lie cant find one five minutes left guys you gotta hurry xavier come on you can do it its right in your path need the purple one you can do it grab it its the purple one whoo hoo hoo lets go all right lets go dont drop it oh my god he came through yes he came through yes sir i got purple whoo whoo lets go xavier for the snake clue its good snake clue all cheering yeah lets go im so pumped that we won the first challenge elektra and i stepped up whoo yeah yes wyatt is on my radar right now and im not sure about xavier congratulations yes thank you thank you three of you are genuinely happy right now whoo lets get it one of you is not a win for the team is great but its also a loss for the snake when i open this box their identity will be one step closer to being revealed here is your first snake clue uh huh suspenseful music this only child loves cosplay and wears many disguises beware that a snake comes in all shapes and sizes tense music i think that we had gotten that thing tomorrow man i guarantee you one you guys would have talked about being a cosplayer cause i want to know and now youre not gonna tell me all laugh all this getting to know each other is gonna happen at camp okay and thats where youre going next youre gonna head to camp and there youre gonna search for your next clue the coordinates to camp are in your watch i will see you guys tomorrow at the second challenge its in my veins now i feel it look in my eyes theres no way to conceal it nothing is written bet you cant feel it truth or im livin good job today guys we survived it now usually im scared of heights too so oh really yeah i just i didnt even think about it i was like hey its my birthday im just gonna happy birthday yeah how old are you thank you oh yes were you the firstborn actually i am the third i have an older sister a twin brother and then its me i have a twin you have a twin too yeah well im not but my younger siblings are twins oh really thats dope yeah athena and orion thats wild what are the odds that yall have twins in the family xavier and elektra have twins in their family thats kind of thats a rare thing so that was kind of interesting to hear something like that oh my gosh its so pretty this is nice not too shabby this is interesting whats over there everybodys already looking for a clue line of ants right here i see little holes im worried about an actual snake oh xavier is this another clue what you guys got back there another clue bust it open bust it open go for it yeah you know what lets not open it yet why why not cause we need to talk man and get some intel before we open it up and find another dead end thats true thats true so save it you want to put it back there lets get to know each other a bit right away wyatt takes charge again and im thinking maybe hes trying to control the game tense music all right team looking like a fire hey we eating tonight i got my marshmallow stick what g i joe lets go blow it out before it goes out thank you so much make a wish whoo did that make you feel home enough man or what yeah it did thank you so much i usually never celebrate my birthday without my twin brother so its like hella weird aw is this your first time celebrating without him yeah aw thats adorable what is he doing to celebrate hes at home with my family from college so where does he go to school he goes to a school in south dakota he has a football scholarship so he plays football out there gee thats whats up yeah wait you both play football no i run track do they know that i was a cheerleader you better come on five six seven eight wait you were a cheerleader thats so cool yeah yep all throughout high school lets start chatting man well hey lets go tell us about you your hobbies cosplay laughter you can try again um i am very connected to the church and i dont partake in the dressing up to cartoon characters for cosplay um i am a baptist woman and we do not play about that the only time i dress up is on sundays tuesdays and thursdays when i am praising almighty so do you sing yes in the choir nice aw something that stood out to me elektra was very religious oh do i have a flag bleep yes oh my god oh my finger bleep bleep but i think shes pretty foulmouthed and im kind of suspicious of that what made you want to come do this honestly stepping out of my comfort zone you know what i mean like i love never ever before anything i do hiking upstate what else can you tell us about you mr interrogation yeah were going damn youre over here like running up on what about yall im an open book you guys can ask me anything im studying nutrition right now nice i try to pick up on clues if someone is lying or telling the truth by how they present themselves and if theyre making eye contact or not my job is just modelling in la i do like content creation and stuff like cosplay no definitely not content creator like the content creator stuff its like on tiktok like for haircare brands and stuff and like for clothes and all that oh xavier is kind of like an influencer so hes really good at getting people to like him he knows how to gain followers and he knows how to put that face on what else yeah we dont know nothing about sam im sorry what about sam sams starting to get snaked out here sam is one that i cant figure out because shes not giving me any tells she is kind of withdrawn that puts a target on her um okay so im sam i have a cute little dog i moved out of my hometown which was a really big step for me but im happy i did it being a single kid is kind of tough huh no i have a little sister shes back home so what sam is the most exciting thing youve ever done in your life you know i went to thailand on a volunteer trip by myself oh wow thats amazing it was so amazing whats the craziest thing youve ever done former military did the navy for eight years the coast guard for six so youve traveled all over huh yeah good for you how many brothers and sisters do you have i have a half brother and i have a stepbrother so thats technically not your biological siblings it said the snake has no siblings i feel like all of us are just kind of looking at each other like okay i dont know man thats a huge red flag should we do our clue while traveling abroad is a part of their past the snake hates the outdoors where they dirty too fast all right huh that is juicy you guys what were you saying again about how many where youve been ive been out of the country a handful of times ive been to laos ive been to mexico ive been in canada wow nice i mean the clues are only clues were gonna have to see how people perform lets remember peoples performances today in the first challenge dude im sorry about that performance today man and you said you havent been out of the country yeah this is my first time and your first time yeah this is my first time too who do you think it might be i feel like its too early to say we havent even done this ah we can get a gut feel i got a i got a suspicion okay im gonna im gonna put my cards on the table and im aiming at you sam chuckles yeah im gonna put my cards on the table and im aiming at you sam why do you think that cause ive been out of the country thats the only other reason i mean on the paper you know people can lie about it i know i know thats true but im just saying apparently i will be transparent i feel like its you oh god i wish i was wait what wait did you just admit it im gonna keep telling you that im not and im gonna tell you that i wish i was we dont want you to tell us we want you to show us in these challenges but i feel like thats what the snake would say though like i wish you know what i mean i think everyone looks a little guilty yeah at this point in the game i can see reasons why everyone could be it whens the last time you went to cosplay i dont i dont cosplay does anyone know someone who does cosplay mm mm right i know sam why you keep pressing her though wyatt is deflecting and calling sam a snake trying to project that onto her its a little suspicious i know g i joe be at the renaissance fairs they dont play with guns in those things you think i want to go in one of those things and play with plastic weapons but youre a man of many trades youve told us a bunch of stuff youre a damn stunt double youve done been to war so i dont put it past you at this point my approach is defending from my experience hard hard hard is a kind of a sign of guilt i think im good so if you guys dont mind i think ima go ahead and brush my teeth and all right this was very constructive you guys it was gives me lots to think about oh my god that is a lot of ants yeah oh no oh my god guys sam screams lets get our bedding ready in fact im gonna make me a damn hammock in the tree with that little sleeping bag i think bro is that a bleep tarantula no no no no no no hell no bleep sam screaming oh hell no no no no not on my watch not on my watch hes like coiling up hes ready to pounce i dont want to seem antisocial but im gonna go to bed soon would a snake kind of only fend for themselves in a sense i love my hammocks thats snake behavior to me in british accent come on over milady get comfy im scared did homey go to sleep grasshopper mer her do you see it laughs you are doing some amanda bynes references and i am digging it dude i used to love amanda bynes the amanda show was my bleep so good so good i would say i do form friendships and bonds quickly i like eggs are you kidding i like eggs iconic and sometimes i will assess that person and see how i can relate to them any way possible i think the bond that im forming with sam is effortless and natural like i just watched shes the man thank you oh my god thats one of my favorite movies im stoked to have someone on my side and i think that we together can find out who the snake is what the bleep is that what a scorpion bro where scorpion oh my bleep god well looks like im not bleep falling asleep now that bleep was huge im not going to sleep dont leave a dragon in the woods your mind is searching ever should if you tie a dragon to a tree i kinda wanna wash my face tense music is this your water yeah i noticed that xavier is really aware about his cleanliness at least i can wash my face and put some deodorant on and then the second clue said that this person doesnt like to get dirty xavier is on my radar again are we all ready all right guys i got the coordinates on the watch looks like were going that way which is north so lets go embrace some suck dramatic music located at the bottom of this crystal clear jungle river there is a large water filled crate inside the crate is a key that will unlock the teams next snake clue the team must use the provided tools to pull the crate from the river and undo the chain securing it if the team can get the key untie and unlock the chest in minutes or less theyll win their final snake clue the challenge starts now listen this is what i think we ought to do i guess apparently its gonna be under that tree thats giving us a clue its right there someone has to go on the tree somebody needs to start getting that rope and stuff to the tree and start trying to rig it up yeah im gonna go see what we got and then ima come back and im gonna start telling you what we need yeah can you swim good yeah all right hey i definitely think we should have partners to start off we dont i dont think we need two people in the water we have to remember somebody in our group is a snake so me and you are going in the water i only need one person in the water so why dont you want me to go with you why dont you want the help because we need the muscle in the tree i know you guys dont trust me but let me tell you guys something this is my element all right im telling you i got to get this why do you want to be the like the huge hero when its a whole team effort im not gonna be a hero all i want to do is go down there and see where it is right im gonna go with you in the water thats what were gonna do all right whatever these two are gonna go into the tree im gonna give you the help all right one could have been opening that box right there though well get it done theres four of us so whatever i know you dont trust me but whatever definitely not x jumps in and decides that he should go into the water he was insistent so i said hey we just got to get going go for it he did not need to be in the water this is my destiny this was always my vision let me show you how im livin this moment that was written here over here you got it babe yeah okay what oh my god oh god it looks like i sabotaged the challenge this is exactly what the snake would do dramatic music it looks like i sabotaged the challenge this looks really bad wait why isnt that dropping now i thought you were supposed to oh my god why isnt it dropping the hook we need the hook whats the reason why i feel what im feelin oh jesus christ pull it back up tell me whats the reason why im dealing with these demons okay how about we go down do you want to start going down there yeah oh bleep why is it so heavy connected the guys are working on the box in the water the women are working on the box on the land theyre trying to untangle this thing so if they get the key they can put it in the box tell me whats the reason why im dealing with these demons theres like hella dirt hey guys grab that rope dont can you not can you not accuse him and just focus xavier was acting like the snake we lost the trunk i knew he didnt need to be in the water could have been up there straightening that shackle out so that could be snakey stop yelling at him and communicate thats not helping yeah go up there and get extra eyes over there and let me know when to pull just yell bleep ten minutes remaining okay its behind you xavier its like right behind you tense music yes lets go come on bleep ten minutes left guys okay okay he is doing the most right now yeah hand me the end of it look at him what are you doing one two three pull pull pull hold on what are you doing tell us what youre doing communicate what are you doing what are you doing pull oh jesus come on pull it pull it you aint telling us nothing damn so right now the way wyatt is barking orders and trying to command the whole situation being so alpha and so demanding determined to prove that he is not the snake is not necessarily sitting well with me come on wyatts acting a little sus to me can we pull it with the rope yes now get this off watch yourself watch yourself four hands working on the chain at the same time got it another end sam there you go i dont want to hear it one minute left down goes elektra yeah careful its gonna happen get it get it get it get it overlapping chatter whoo nice job all cheering yeah all that lets go yeah bobby nice job you guys have the key congratulations yes lets go lets go im gonna open the box and were gonna pull out the third and final snake clue whoo its gonna mean something good work guys here we go the third clue is as follows with pom poms and spirit the snake cheered in a gym dramatic music but when in a group wont go out on a limb xavier you looked at the two ladies why im not a cheerleader it just said pom poms and gym yeah i was like im not a cheerleader either i dont think g i joe is a cheerleader thank you youre welcome i bet you im not a good cheerleader anyway i was throwing some mad shade with that side eye but they said pom poms in a gym and i was like oh i was like thats sam the challenge may be over but the game definitely is not over the most intense part of this game is yet to happen because thats at the snake pit you have your watches grab your stuff your gps will get you back to camp good job team good job guys all right get it with the pom poms being thrown in sam looks suspicious because sam literally told me last night shes a cheerleader pom poms cheerleading i mean its not quantum physics weapons are stowed the battle is over man no more of that yes sir well move on now we got to start planning for the pit right yeah the snake pit i am nervous for the snake pit im not gonna lie with that last clue suspicions are rising with me i was a cheerleader so my strategy moving forward is to really connect with elektra get her on my side let her know that im not lying cause at this point i can see why they think it would be me but im not the snake it comes down to just talking and trusting each other yes tense music im not the snake it just looks it looks so bad i swear it is not me i really do appreciate our conversations and like i really hope that you trust me i dont know i really dont think its you i know like i dont want to think its you either and i dont but at this point everyone is just like so good at lying okay im gonna say this very quietly could be xavier hes in la a lot of modeling a lot of acting that goes with cosplay xavier is really athletic he is in great shape and he currently is in college right now so maybe he is you know a male cheerleader elektra her being like very very religious but then like has a really foul mouth bleep yeah well for a church girl you got a mouth on you i know right bleep come on come on come on oh this is hot bleep were gonna have to come to a complete collaboration exactly ominous music welcome to the snake pit it is here that we will go over everything that you have been through as we figure out together who the snake is let me remind you guys at the end of this three of you will have to agree who the snake is because if three of you agree and youre right the team will split if three of you agree and youre wrong the snake will get all the money and the team gets nothing if youre not the snake itll be your job to convince your teammates that you are not the snake so the game is still happening right now in the snake pit you know every word in these clues have a meaning as to who the snake is in over the last two days did anything catch your attention um id have to say it was probably after the second clue and what did the clue say while travelling abroad is a part of their past the snake hates the outdoors where they dirty too fast we previously talked about where have you been where have you traveled and both wyatt and i just said that we have been out of the country so of course when we read it i was like that could be either of us i was in the military so i got to travel all over the world it it points to me and him so yeah what about the line doesnt like to get dirty some people are really aware about cleanliness who our friends in the middle here i think like yeah im clean i like to be clean and fresh so an indicator too that made me think it might be her was the third clue with pom poms and spirit the snake cheered in a gym but when in a group wont go out on a limb what did you think that meant at the time it meant a lot man im not gonna lie hearing that third clue it messed me up so the night before me and sam we were just literally just talking and she had mentioned that she was a cheerleader the second you said pom poms when i tell you i literally felt my heart fall i was just like no xavier im watching your expression youre looking around at your teammates mm hmm whered your mind go it had to be the same as elektra after that third clue after she had already told us shes a cheerleader and just stuff like that im gonna have to say i think that its sam hopefully my teammates feel the same way elektra i really want to hone in with you because i know that weve been really good friends this whole time and i just really really hope that you take to heart what we talked about elektra im looking at you youre struggling suspenseful music the evidence is not helping yeah its bec like i like groans i like obviously have like a deep connection with sam like she literally looked me in my eyes and shes like its not me its not me so like i still mean that it is still girl code all the way dude dont go based off of emotion you gotta go based off of what you saw and go with your feeling that you have already yeah and your feeling of course shes gonna plead her case but also of course go off of your feeling thats a fight no its not i think it is xavier little things that he was like i wanna take a shower i want to get clean and then i know my girl elektra she camps up in new york wyatt you do search and rescue so like i know youre not afraid to get your hands dirty its time to vote you guys were literally about to lose elektra really think about this dude i swear on everything on my like everything dude it is not me you guys were literally about to lose elektra really think about this dude i swear on everything on my like everything dude i swear it is not me tense music its time to vote up first wyatt youll take your piece and youll turn it front facing to the person that you think is the snake next up elektra xavier youre next no hard feelings final vote sam its now time to see who you guys think is the snake first vote sam second vote sam third vote xavier two votes sam one vote xavier and the fourth and final vote sam so you guys obviously all think its sam if sam is the snake you three will share if sam is not the snake and one of you three are you just won all the money the question is will the real snake please stand up gasps laughs elektra congratulations lets talk about this what was your strategy deny deny deny the only thing i could think of to deflect liking cosplay is make it about religion i am very connected to the church and i dont partake in the dressing up to cartoon characters for cosplay people are kind of touchy about the subject you never want to offend someone elses religion oh nice the choir is like my home thats whats up no ones gonna challenge a black womans belief on religion they have a better chance of meeting beyonc so are you into church like are you heavily into no not at all not even a little bit okay wait you really sold us thats why i was believing it the second clue im immediately saying this is my first time out of the country this is actually my second time in costa rica oh its your second time even here yeah the first time i went with my family as for the third clue with pom poms and spirit the snake cheered in a gym sam mentioned that she was a cheerleader the second she said that i was just like oh okay shes a cheerleader too and initially normally the first thing i do when someone mentions something that i obviously have in common you relate with them oh yeah me too but i didnt say me too i was like oh thats cool thats cool challenge wise you werent gonna sabotage i wasnt gonna sabotage like there was no way elektra had like a foul mouth for a church girl but other than that she really had me fooled like she really did that so she did a great job im just im shocked that it was her i didnt want to think it was her were pulling this girl code stuff i think all boys are snakes so wheres the lie cant find one in british accent come on over milady i feel like if you can make people laugh you can make them feel comfortable enough to not think that its you i feel horrible are you kidding me shes the sweetest girl ever you could just take me out later for a shopping spree like i want to visit her in nashville like shes such a good vibe when everyone turned against me it hurt i totally got played elektra did the whole girl code girl power i let my guard down and i found out that i am really loyal to a fault my biggest takeaway from this crazy experience is yes you can be a very trusting and loyal person but its always good to keep your guard up and to put yourself first you played a heck of a game brilliant you shouldnt feel guilty when you know its a game you play hard and you worry about feelings later and also sometimes the most dangerous snakes are one you never suspect no the snake struck and the snake won good good job dude thank you thats respect you earned it thats a respectful clap right there karma could possibly come back and get me for using religion as an advantage point to win but i mean i have to pay for medical bills so im not too worried about it i feel like a super genius yeah you did that i mean bleep \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

find out lets get rollin food truck road trip right now eight teams of very nervous dreamers are making their way to long beach california this is the starting line for the third coasttocoast food truck race thousands applied but only eight teams of wouldbe food truck operators made the cut yeah whoo they are pizza mikes from columbus ohio mike pat and carlo are all veteran pizza makers with years of experience in restaurants we have great crust we have great sauce homemade sausage all our stuffs natural it starts from the bottom up but three years ago mikes restaurant career ended in flames a fire destroyed the family business that was quite a blow i wasnt ready for retirement were looking to try to reopen in a different location its justits a tough market right now this is our chance to get back in the game right here whoohoo fuhgeddaboudit you got that right baby next up mommas grizzly grub angela her daughter adriane and her best friend tiffany its go time go time angela left her job as a financial analyst and is now on a mission to bring a food truck to a place that doesnt really have a lot of them wasilla alaska the thing that i love most is taking classic favorites and turning them into a gourmet pasta dish oh that has got a little kick to it i will take the flavors of fajitas mix it with rotini and we have something new and oh yeah guess what gave her that idea the great food truck race uh watched every episode a little embarrassing to admit but i actually tape them all and watch them over and over again i wonder what other teams are like and where theyre from hey theyre from the lower how tough could they be this is team popawaffle buddies bobaloo and scott have been trapped in deadend jobs for years but they think their gourmet waffle concept could make them millions give me that waffle iron tyler and i will work it out a food truck will give these funlovin l a guys their freedom but neither have any culinary training of any kind so they turn to an upandcoming local chef to bring some kitchen skills anthony you are our secret weapon owning a food truck would change my life because i would no longer have to answer to the man waffle for your face meet the barbie babes hayley jasmin and skye these three friends from down under came to l a in search of adventure and started a catering company to make ends meet barbie babes was a concept of mine i came up with just purely out of the struggles just to stay in the u s a were just little aussie battlers these sheilas are on a mission to bring australianstyle barbecue to their adopted hometown starting with their burgers and sausage sandwiches its gonna be off the charts cool dudes youve got under the crust trained chef hannah her mother sheri and her culinary school buddy gary i think pie makes like everyone smile hannahs sweet and savory pies are a huge seller at farmers markets across the san diego area anything can be a pie because its whats inside that matters hannah had big plans to start a food truck with her fianc keith but tragedy derailed that dream keith was diagnosed with cancer he passed away eight months later this was kind of like our dream together so its aits really difficult without him you know keith loved cooking andwell my cooking so especially your cooking yeah yeah it means everything to me to get it off the ground oh my gosh i cant believe were here youve got coast of atlanta lena her boyfriend mike and their buddy tawanaca are all experienced chefs who want to get out of other peoples kitchens and cook for themselves my dream is to own my own seafood truck and cook all day these three have the skills and a whole mess of southern style seafood to offer we got our shrimp and grits we got our fish and grits we got our collard greens whole lot of flavor in the south baby whole lot of flavor come on lets do this fist bump fist bump for sure this is the seoul sausage team out of l a s koreatown brothers ted and yong and their chef friend chris have taken the l a festival circuit by storm with their korean sausages and burgers we constantly get people coming up to us and saying whens your next event but if we can get a food truck we can do this every day and we can bring this food to the people but these first generation korean americans have more than just the bottom line to worry about their traditional parents wanted them to have professional careers and now its time to put up or shut up were pretty much all in we dont have a backup option its seoul sausage or bust at this point were gonna do this man screw being a doctor screw being a lawyer dude lets make sausages for a living and then theres nonnas kitchenette we are so excited right girls jaclyn lisa and jessica these best friends from jersey want a food truck so

trash bags terry cloths if i dont get everything on this list we cant even open for business holy crap i really need this many this list is gonna screw us over trying to find all of the health department supplies is a little frustrating horrible this is ridiculous everything has to be multiple boxes of stuff you know what we can use em later were not going home good grief its really cutting into the budget lets see if they have a sausage press sausage presses and grinders arent the cheapest thing in the world thats like at least bucks i only have thats way too expensive were running out of time and options so we need to come up with something fast were just gonna do the beef only just make beef kalbi burgers and we have no time we want to get out there we need to sell by doing the burgers we dont have to worry about getting a sausage press and thats gonna save us a couple hundred dollars right there pounds dude this is a competition this is what were gonna do and this is how were gonna do it now we just want to get items that we just need for this one bare essentials bare essentials our menu is going to have a classic aussie burger a portobello burger some fat fries with red desert dust cant be australian without our desert dust in our red desert dust weve got lots of cayenne salt pepper paprika and a whole bunch of other stuff why are things called different things in different countries ive never bought so much food in my entire life lets get it all on there start throwin em in to me do you want to start sorting she said we gotta stay on she said we gotta stay on i do may i borrow it for a sec what are you doing just to doublecheck mike no youall right you dont have to you dont have to oh my god i cannot believe this are you serious mike youre giving information to our opponents if they dont have their health code information thats not our problem chill out its really not that serious tawanaca huh isnt important to him a new truck a business havin a life that you asked for is not important to you you can go home chill out i think lena and tawanaca are blowing this out of proportion i dont think its that serious its just a health code list im just a goodhearted person right here turn go this way turn in turn in turn im a tiny bit leery about driving that giant truck parallel park oh mercy we are not in alaska anymore keep comin keep comin but im in the road im not even close youre gonna have to back up and pull back in i feel like im on a different planet im doing it okay stop if i can parallel park this thing in downtown l a i can do anything we cant park but we can cook back up there we go for sure we want to sell where our roots are which is koreatown korean people love to eat they love to drink its a nobrainer basically what were gonna do today its the kalbi sausage that we normally do just take that same marinade same meat and just turn it into a burger the first thing that you need is korean spices soy sauce kochu chang which is a korean pepper paste kochukaru which is korean pepper flakes chamgireum which is sesame oil just add some of our hamburger meat and its just autopilot from there welcome to seoul sausage youre our absolute first customer can we get some sausages we dont have sausages but we have a delicious hamburger yeah okay can we get three three we got one burger right here burgers are really good i mean its its very tasty you can taste the green onions inside and its just really juicy and really good what im gonna cry youre kidding is that with discount its already discounted honey this is really bad we have to take at least worth of stuff off our trolley i dont care about that they can go oh no no no stop i insist on that because those burgers are so huge theres nothing to hold them together not today theyre not this shopping trip that were doing is taking forever forever forever i feel like were never going to leave this shop we just have to find a parking spot park prep were gonna gowere gonna go to a parking lot okay im gonna talk to the attendant were going to l a live we know that there are gonna be a lot of people out just go in just go so gary can get in too were gonna try and find somewhere to park season passes only in here do you know anywhere around here that food trucks can park one more block this is bad this is really bad were so far behind the curve right now were so far behind the curve right now we like seriously need to find find a place to park otherwise were screwed i cant believe we havent even started the third great food truck race has just begun and all of our rookie teams are learning quickly that running a food truck is much tougher than it looks that running a food truck is much tougher than it looks this is not supposed to be easy the pie makers of under the crust failed to secure a spot at l a live can i make a left no this is ridiculous and now they have no idea where to set up and sell if we pull over here we can at least get some stuff done and were in the general location mommas grizzly grub is realizing that downtown los angeles is a long way from wasilla alaska bucks you get a dessert and a meal lets go nope lets not go the australian barbie babes are finding out the hard way that food truck budgets are exceptionally tight your new total is thats a little better we can do that thats in our budget and pizza mikes is looking for a parking spot on hollywood boulevard were definitely in the money if we can find a spot huh good luck mike mikey right there park there we got this spot here it aint the greatest but its a spot its out of the action a little bit but well take what we can get at this point finally getting back in the kitchen baby yeah this is gonna be our italian beef sirloin cut really thin with a real nice au jus were gonna put some roasted red some sweet onions on there some nice green bell peppers im passionate about this business im passionate about my food its been about three years since the restaurant burned down im back in my element now this is fun my beefs ready my stratas are ready i got my bread cut im all set up tighten up baby get your down on the corner now you want to eat we got some good food down there oh man its gonna be spicy now thank you folks god bless you very good i see a lot of foot traffic which i absolutely love echo park is a great little neighborhood its right on a bus route theres plenty of foot traffic and theres gonna be plenty of parking first successful parking job we dont have a lot of time to get open we dont have a lot of time to scramble around making sure we have a full crazy menu for everybody to look at we need to focus on getting our first waffle out the door just one classic waffle thats it love it between bob and i were gonna handle the prep and try to knock out as much as we possibly can as fast as possible even though were working with just one waffle iron ladies and gentlemen boys and girls are you ready for some waffles waffle coming up up next is pat pat hey barbie babes whats up hi honey were just wondering where you are because weve finally finished all of our shopping the barbie babes are looking for a place we wanted to share some los angeles love with those ladies if you see one truck thats great but if you see two trucks it may boost some business at this point im concerned that weve fallen too far behind were not even gonna open today this doesnt feel good the vibe between us all has really gone down a notch do you want me to get out there and try to sell us something no were not selling anything tonight its been a really long day and were in like a horrible location i think we just need to get some rest and try way better tomorrow because i am not giving this truck up we havent even prepped yet theres no way were making that giant menu that we thought about at the beginning were gonna have to do more prep in the morning were just gonna do our chicken pot pie our beef cut pie and a strawberry pie were gonna just have to pray that we sell something tomorrow this is you know what i worked for and what keith and i dreamed about and we have to come back and we have to come back and we have to do it tomorrow my worst nightmare is going home the first week its day in los angeles and our eight teams of food truck rookies are all stocking up on ice water and fuel at a local commissary and then where does this go on the ground uh we need this right this is our extension cord under the crust is finally ready to open but theyre struggling to master the basics you hook the generator up to over here no no just turn this on it will power everything right so we plug it in just like we would if we were docked here right yeah meanwhile the other seven teams are ready to tackle sunday in l a well be ready to go like in an hour nonnas kitchenette is ready to take their meatballs to hollywood i dont have change to give to people so im gonna be freaking out and coast of atlanta is betting that a seafood truck will do well at you guessed itthe beach so right now were getting some peppers sauted to go with our onions itll be the topping for our quesadillas i know as a chef a huge menu can mean a lot of prep work and a lot of overhead quality over quantity you make sure that your food is good were gonna do a really limited menu of seafood tacos and quesadillas but our food is beautiful and thats gonna help bring some people to our truck nice peach pico de gallo it cant get any better than that fish tacos salmon quesadillas anybody anybody please weve been open minutes to an hour venice beach is completely dead we have got to do something about this situation theyre not coming to us we have to go to them yep surely they want water lets go make it happen lets go excuse me would yall like any water for sir would you like some water no its not free its oh this we cant afford to just sit here and wait and wait and wait i gave up everything to come out here i spent every dime i had i am not ready to go home right now so whatd we say i am about to cut some garlic and im going to caramelize it so i can throw it into the sauce then well add some fresh basil and then we will throw in our meatballs that we cooked and prepped last night our menu is meatballs sausage pepper sandwiches crispy goat cheese salad and an italian grilled cheese but the thing is weve gotten our recipes from our nonnas i just hope that we can make these little normal size recipes amazing and big its the hardest thing ive ever done in my entire life ever ever all right so we got three kalbi two tots and a kpop were in ktown like look at this look at the love we get i mean thats the soul we put into our food like we do the same thing with our people like blood sweat and tears and our soul i mean this is what were all about this is you know were called seoul sausageseoul but we do put the soul into it too i need two kalbi and one tot can we just get the socal and the chicken pot pie okay sure sure what was your name and those arethose are each okay jack you are our very first sale so you have no idea how much i love you right now my chicken pot pie is my one pie that without fail everybody loves this is the very first chicken pot pie that were gonna throw in the fryer and then this is the socal meat pie thats very similar to a pizzoli style its got green chilies and some top round in it these are gonna be kind of empanada style but superflaky crust finally we get a sale and i feel like okay maybe this is a turning point hopefully well have more great customers like jack i think were probably better in numbers trying to get the waffle boys down again if theyre around yeah oh theyre calling me the waffle guys just seem like a really good team that we should get with hello business theyre selling waffles were selling barbecue we love their energy can i please have a classic waffle sure absolutely our first customers on day are kids who of course want the classic waffle this is my favorite waffle ever i want to eat the whole thing we know that we can actually produce it at this point we want to see if we can flesh out that menu just a little bit chef anthony is ready to go with a mexicanstyle fajita waffle this is a cornmeal fajita batter its got some fajita seasoning in it chives theres some cayenne pepper in it order up for josh chicken fajita waffle not yet weve just had a little bit of a glitch unfortunately our grill isnt working the pilot light is out were a barbecue truck how are we going to cook snags and burgers when i cant even get the flattop working so the pilot lights off we cant grill today girls so the pilot lights off we cant grill today girls what ive tried every combination i possibly can to get this thing started and i cant get it going theres just over a half day left in l a and some teams are adapting quicker to their new food trucks than others i couldve been a brain surgeon but im slingin burgers i couldve been a brain surgeon but im slingin burgers seoul sausage is slammed and so is pizza mikes mikey veggie all right look at that coast of atlanta knows how to make food they just cant find any customers please get some food at the blue truck and the barbie babes cant figure out how to light their pilot light which is a crushing problem for a barbecue truck ill have a sausage sandwich please sausage sandwich yeah um were having a little bit of problems at the moment were having trouble with lighting our pilot weve had a bit of problems today oh really oh yeah do you know anything about that well im a chef maybe i can help really yeah guys we have a chef oh really seriously this is a perfect example of how aussies stick together and help each other out got it success we dont even

pepper sandwich fresh meatball sandwiches italian grilled cheese go jacs go we are parked on hollywood there are so many tourists we are ready finally to start selling meatball sandwich one two were pricing our menu a little higher between and because thats what i believe is fair things are looking great right now thank you so much enjoy enjoy okay so hours ago our teams had never even stepped foot in a food truck and now theyre stocked supplied and selling and thats incredible so just when theyre starting to get comfortable its time to turn up the heat it is the great food truck race after

you guys getting the hang of this food truck thing were getting better its all right okay good well its time for your very first speed bump speed bump oh no oh come on you guys knew this was comin oh yeah we did okay so heres the deal a huge part of running a successful food truck is making great food no doubt about it uhhuh but theres a whole other part too which is standing out from the competition tell me how to stand out from the competition please if youre gonna succeed youre gonna have to figure out how to get out of your truck attract a crowd and then convince people that youre better than the truck parked down the street or in this case well parked right next to you right next to us yep the rest of your time in l a will be a bumpertobumper salesmanship showdown what

at the towns pretty towers most of us have been here before preferably wednesday or saturday when there is free entry lets look down on the streets you will be surprised that you do not see a single person the explanation is straightforward it is sunday morning at around oclock people are still in their deepest slumber they have no idea that it is a delightful morning and that the sun has gilded the citys roofs they will protest and say that this only happens in movies but it is a film and there you are allowed to embellish things like i said its early so we have time to look around a bit the weather is clear so we can see the skyscrapers out on bellahoj lets get closer so we can see a skyscraper on the top floor we look in at the district court prosecutor hartsen we find him fast asleep with his sweet wife by his side did i say sweet maybe but damn how they argued before they fell sleep the lady blamed her woman dear husband for his behavior at the supreme court prosecutor something or other she is lets entrust you with that right away very jealous and combative while we let them sleep in peace we will show you another smaller house and the widow hald lives there she sleeps safely she has a small annuity after her husband who had taken out a beautiful life insurance policy and she has two sweet daughters johanne and grete did i say sweeet again you can also say pretty

im not sharing confidential police work with a teenager stiles is that it on the board behind you dont look at that all right avert your eyes okay stilinski hey avert stiles i see arrows pointing at pictures okay okay stop fine i found something mechanic and the couple who were murdered they all had something in common all three yeah you know what i always say ones an incident twos coincidence threes a pattern the mechanic the husband the wife all the same age all wait a minute what about mr lahey isaacs dad isnt anywhere near which made me think that either a laheys murder wasnt connected or b the ages were a coincidence until i found this which would be c did you know that isaac lahey had an older brother named cameron died in combat but if he were alive today take one guess as to how old hed be twenty four matt what how much are tickets can i borrow some money yeah how much now what if same age means same class did you think of that yeah well i wouldve i mean i just got laheys file two hours ago two hours dad people could be dying yeah im aware of that thank you stiles same class okay this is it class of they all went to beacon hills including isaacs brother all right but so what if they all knew each other you know i mean two of them were married so maybe they all just hung out well they could have had the same classes together they couldve what same teacher stiles harris they were all in his class all four and i dont know how mr lahey fits in but this kid this is definitely a pattern all right give me the yearbook these names we need faces which ones everyone in that chemistry class if the killers not done killing then one of thems next yeah yeah its stilinski sighs next eerie music playing how many lets go lets get out of here lets go this one sean sean was killed by this thing gerard says is a kind of shape shifter it hasnt been around for centuries the thing you shot outside the club the other night south american legend we know of calls it the kanima this one jessica muttering breathing heavily she was smothered to death after giving birth the police think it was done by someone else we think its a person whos controlling this other shape shifter that means two killers allison one human one not you know the question i had after gerard first told me about our family why us he quoted me winston churchill the price of greatness is responsibility personally i think its more about knowledge but we know the truth we know about the world that makes us responsible for a young couple their newborn daughter anyone that doesnt have the power to defend themselves are you starting to get it i get that this isnt a lecture its an interrogation that depends on what you know gerard showed me the library cameras didnt catch everything but do you really think a little high school fight can explain that amount of damage we know youre trying to protect your friends but people are dying a child was orphaned what you know makes you responsible it makes you responsible for this voice quavering what do you want me to tell you anything you know anything that can lead us to answering the one question that might mean everything who controls the kanima whats he doing here i need him i dont trust him yeah well he doesnt trust you either you know what and derek really doesnt care now wheres the vet is he going to help us or not that depends your friend jackson are we planning to kill him or save him derek kill him scott at the same time save him save him save him watch what you touch so what are you some kind of witch no im a veterinarian unfortunately i dont see anything here thats going to be an effective defense against a paralytic toxin were open to suggestions what about an effective offense derek we already tried i nearly took its head off and argent emptied an entire clip into it the thing just gets back up has it shown any weaknesses well one it cant swim does that go for jackson as well scott no hes the captain of the swim team essentially youre trying to catch two people opens closes drawer a puppet and a puppeteer one killed the husband but the other had to take care of the wife do we know why i dont think jackson could do it his mother died pregnant too and she was maybe murdered i think he couldnt let the same thing happen to someone else how do you know its not part of the rules the kanima kills murderers if jackson kills the wife then the baby dies too does that mean your father was a murderer wouldnt surprise me if he was hold on the book says theyre bonded right what if the fear of water isnt coming from jackson but from the person controlling him what if something that affects the kanima also affects its master meaning what meaning we can catch them both of them rock music playing theres got to be some other way to get tickets right stiles its a secret show theres only one way and its a secret hey either of you guys know why no ones getting suspended after what happened the other day at school just forget about it nobody got hurt i had a concussion well nobody got seriously hurt i was in the er for six hours hey do you want to know the truth matt your little bump on the head is about this high on our list of problems right now scott sighs are you okay yeah im fine now so you didnt get any tickets last night either are they still selling no but i managed to find two online you should keep trying sounds like everyones going to be there i dont like him hey are you sure about this last time whoevers controlling jackson had to kill somebody because he didnt finish the job so what do you think hes going to do this time be there to make sure it happens indistinct chatter door slams can anybody tell me where the hell jackson is and why he missed morning practice i thought i told you to keep an eye on him stilinski jackson sorry coach i havent seen him since the last time i saw him oh and when was that last time i saw him was definitely the time i saw him last again danny tell jackson no missing practice this close to the championships okay sure coach that goes for all of you i should be coaching college door closes sorry but i only got two myself do you even have a date man im working on it okay okay hear me out you give us the tickets and you devote your life to abstinence and just how do you two losers even survive what are we supposed to do no ones even selling sighs wait here boys what is he gonna loud clattering yup thats excessive crashing thatll bruise ow okay pop music playing sighs enjoy the show im sorry i know that you said we cant talk like this anymore what happened sighs my dad and i um he knows about the last two murders he knows that there are two killers and he and gerard are hey its okay thats not bad if he knows fine im actually more worried about your mom what does that mean you remember when i got called out of detention to go to the office she was the one that talked to me and she was asking me all these questions about us like really really specific questions and there were pencils being sharpened pencils just trust me it was bad sighs um and i i think that we should do something like um like be seen with other people like be seen dating maybe more what um stammering well i dont know how it happened or why i even said yes but im actually supposed to hang out with matt oh oh great thats perfect go out with him seriously yeah and make a big deal out of it in front of your mom okay even kiss him if you have to kiss him are you sure about that uh totally disappointed oh like really kiss him well whats really kiss him like like pop music playing sighs yeah dont do that what is it nothing i gotta go i love you you too ominous music playing scott ketamine its the same stuff we use on the dogs just a higher dosage if you can get close enough to jackson it should slow him down enough to buy you some time this is some of what youll use to create the barrier this part is for you stiles only you uh that sounds like a lot of pressure can we maybe find a slightly less pressure filled task for me deaton its from the mountain ash tree which is believed by many cultures to protect against the supernatural this office is lined with ash wood making it difficult for someone like scott to cause me any trouble okay so then what i just spread this around the whole building and then either jackson or whoevers controlling him cant cross it theyll be trapped doesnt sound too hard deaton not all there is think of it like gunpowder its just powder until a spark ignites it you need to be that spark stiles if you mean light myself on fire i dont think im up for that let me try a different analogy i used to golf i learned that the best golfers never swing before first imagining where they want the ball to go they see it in their mind and their mind takes over it can be pretty extraordinary what the force of your own will can accomplish force of will hey if this is going to work stiles you have to believe it inhales hmm cabinets rattle all right the partys in a warehouse just inside the industrial sector allison has learned that jackson whittemore will be there seeking his next target out of the crowd since we still have little clue as to just how strong he is we need to be extremely cautious when allison has jacksons location and has determined him to be at the optimal point where we can take him down shell signal me optimal meaning as far away from the crowd as possible there will be no collateral damage tonight go ahead as willing a participant as she seems your young protege there also appears to be under the impression that we are planning a trap magazine snaps into place i think she doesnt need to know any more than that for the rest of us then lets be perfectly clear you dont trap a creature this dangerous you kill it running footsteps hey cant talk got to run hey wait wait wait whats wrong nothing soft pop music playing wheres your gun i left it at the station along with my badge what its all right you know what well talk about this later dad dont worry about it dad sighs it was decided that the son of a police chief stealing police property and having a restraining order filed against him by one of the towns most respected attorneys did not reflect well on the county they fired you no look its just a leave of absence its temporary did they say it was temporary or actually no you know its fine dont worry about it hey were going to be fine stammering dad i dont get it why arent you angry at me i dont know maybe i just dont want to feel any worse than i already do by having to yell at my son oh shoot you okay yeah why you just didnt say anything the whole way here no im fine lets grab the other bag i cant remember deaton said you have to do it alone okay this plan is really starting to suck no not here not now what scott what am i supposed to plan officially sucks dance music playing matt give me a second okay what are you doing you told me to go out with him no not here you dont get it we have a plan you have a plan okay okay my father and gerard theyre coming here what did you tell them i i told them allison stammering i had to tell them oh my god they know its jackson people are dying scott what am i supposed to do youre supposed to trust me i trust you more than anyone we had a plan so do they this isnt going to work what do you want me to do okay i can fix it please please scott just tell me just stay out of the way scott just stay out of the way thunder rumbling gerard careful gentlemen something wicked this way comes dance music playing isaac why me because i got to make sure that argent doesnt completely ruin the plan okay look you better do it intravenously which means in the vein when you find him you pull back on this plunger right here in the neck is probably going to be the easiest so you find a vein jam it in there pull back on the trigger be careful chuckles oh i doubt itll even slightly hurt him no i mean you i dont want you to get hurt derek back off back off thats really all youve got i got to be honest chris i was really expecting more from the big bad veteran werewolf hunter okay then how about didnt anyone ever tell you not to bring claws to a gunfight guns click yeah that one sounded pretty good dance music playing gun shots gun shots in the distance gun shots groans growls grunts electricity crackling grunting in monster voice she belongs to me oh no tires squealing scott pick up pick up now look i got like feet of ash left and im out okay so you got to get your wolf ass down here to help me because i dont know what to do and im just standing out here and im gun shots and im all alone and im hearing gunfire and werewolves and im standing here like a freaking idiot all by myself with a handful of magic fairy dust and i dont have enough okay okay come on think um okay he said you got to believe you need to believe come on believe stiles just picture it just imagine it working okay just imagine exhales laughing yes car alarm goes off you probably recognize this device pot used to be smoked in a rolled up piece of paper these days it seems like all you kids are given a free vaporizer with your medicinal marijuana card this type of wolfsbane is one of my favorites lovely smell you probably wont think so scott weakly what what are you doing victoria isnt it obvious im killing you door opens no no no just me its just me dont freak is he okay well lets find out groans god ah breathing heavily okay no one does anything like that again okay oh i thought the ketamine was supposed to put him out yeah well apparently this is all were going to get so lets just hope that whoevers controlling him just decided to show up tonight jackson in monster voice im here im right here with you victoria its going to look like an accident like you had an asthma attack and couldnt get to your inhaler in time your school records show you have a pretty severe case of asthma stop coughs too late looks like its working claws dragging uh uh uh dance music playing want to move closer to the dj shes i told you id see a student here breathing heavily straining i think i stopped healing bullets theyre laced with wolfsbane you got to go to the car what about you i have to find scott go yelling go jackson is that you in monster voice us were all here are you the one killing people we are the ones killing murderers so all the people youve killed so far deserved it see we got a little rule book that says you only go after murderers anything can break if enough pressures applied all right so the people youre killing are all murderers then all each every one well who did they murder me wait what what do you mean they murdered me neck cracking they murdered me breathing weakly dance music playing not having a good time are you ever feel like you have the best intentions but youre just making one mistake after another no unlike the rest of humanity im perfect both laugh uh laughs nervously im sorry that was a huge mistake im sorry no its okay its okay its okay actually its not okay but i have to go make a call so ominous string music playing okay all right more ketamine the man needs ketamine come on we dont have any more you used the whole bottle snarls um okay out everybody out go go go go okay find something to move in

            "File content:  baby cant you see narrator previously on love island usa sereniti timmy uh kick rocks narrator there were new couples youre toxic narrator new dangers no narrator and an impossible choice who goes and who stays will be decided by your fellow islanders shut the fuck up im slippin under im addicted to you dont you know that youre toxic narrator tonight its decision time oh my gosh this is crazy its so hard to make a decision narrator and get ready for two new arrivals shut up whats up ladies glass clinking cheering islanders cheering whats up yall support us and become vip member to remove all ads from open fire rapid fire photographs taken narrator last night bria chose sereniti for her brother chazz and he chose timmy for sister bria what followed was the most shocking sibling moment since valentines day at the lannisters cellphone chimes got a text evie borgias bang bang playing one left in the chamber bang bang islanders in your couples you must now to save either zita or tyler jesus fucking christ whoever receives the fewest votes will be dumped from the island immediately ricochet oh my god ricochet ricochet ricochet narrator four remaining couples must now decide whether to dump the islander with the pretty face eyes you could drown in and flowing locks or zeta oh my gosh this is crazy this is awful god this sucks shits fucked up i did not see this coming they both deserve to fucking be here the closer to the edge theres nothing to regret so what do you think its so hard to make the decision i love zeta and i love tyler they both bring so much you know positivity and light to everybody around the villa i feel like tyler just got here he hasnt had a fair chance yeah i like him personally you know i had time to know him more but i also like zeta a lot you know its hard to make one decision sereniti and tyler have definitely developed like a connection together and sereniti shell obviously be upset if tyler leaves but no shes going to be hurt i mean maybe chazz could give her everything that she thought yeah tyler was lacking in a sense right yeah he was excited to talk to you it sucks i think i just think that you know if zeta was around some shit would get fucking wild up in this bitch i would say the only con of saving zeta is just the fact that maybe timmy feels a little constrained of like he has many exploring options thats like to pick somebody who has a connection or somebody who is still looking for a connection i think we just have to put like our personal feelings aside and just think of like whats best for the villa okay uh huh you will you wait another second you narrator the first couple to vote is deb and jesse we decided to save this islander because i truly believe they have a fair chance at love and me and deb truly believe that their journey is not yet done so the islander we would like to save is zeta whispers thank you narrator next up is sydney and andy andy sighs this was an extremely hard decision and we both love you so very much weve decided to save this islander because they are strong courageous empathetic and have made an impact since the very first day theyve been in the villa our ultimate factor was the connection they formed within the villa and that is why weve made this decision nik ammars beacons playing all the sparks scattered afar across the world so the islander we would like to save is zeta in the depth of the darkness around me theres a storm narrator zeta has two votes and if the next couple pick her she will be safe next to vote is courtney and felipe we are choosing to save this islander because this islander is just genuinely who they are and they live every day with their hearts open to the world they have mastered the art of being both soft and strong this islander is unapologetically and genuinely themselves we believe this islander still has a story to tell so the islander we want to save is zeta all the beacons in the night standing stronger with every fight all the beacons in the night standing up for what is right standing up narrator next up mady and isiah we believe that this islander still has a story here and we cannot function here in the villa without them so the islander that we would like to save is zeta all the beacons in the night standing up cellphone chimes tyler youre now single and dumped from the

after recoupling of some bridges might be burned but im really hoping that theyre not fully burned yet so i just want a chance to prove to her that i want this obviously like i still have feelings for you but it worries me a little bit because i know like you were easily swayed and its like if i were to give you a second chance and we start building like a good foundation if someone walks in are you going to be swayed again im very much open minded to potentially giving him another chance but fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me giggles so i will definitely need to like see actions yes i will work on making every action to show you that mm hmm that this is what i want okay dont get too cuddly in bed with him at night now laughing oh andy narrator sorry whats that thing

like youre being welcomed nicely yeah for sure starting off with a smiling breakfast was definitely a great step laughing im a simp for the smiley face oh yeah yeah yeah it was a nice little touch i put on it im laughing that little razzle dazzle yeah that little chazzle dazzle chazzle dazzle bro quit it chazz is very very sweet and very kind he listens and he takes the time to have acts of service that cares about like my feelings and how i feel about myself so im definitely gonna give it a chance a girl like you deserves so much more that a guy should be going out of their way to talk to you and shit like that but im glad they not because now who would have thought who would have thought who would have thought look at us look at us laughing narrator zetas not happy that bria ended up with timmy zeta recons bria needs to take a long hard look at herself in the mirror or failing that her shades i kind of wanted to pull you because i feel like theres definitely some tension theres like the obvious like reason why but i just wanna know more so why its directed at me theyre talking right now yeah i saw that its not fun its just a lot yeah i feel like obviously you knew you was interested in timmy like you you said that he was one of the people you was interested in its just quite easy for you because your brothers like had to make the decision now its all just like well my brother chose it and thats it but in my spirit in my heart i know you would have chosen timmy or is that wrong to to think i would have chosen him on my own thank you for saying that i really respect that so for me i just already felt like an energy that you werent trying to get that close to me and i knew it was because you want to crack on with timmy which is fine but if youre asking me where mine is coming from thats where its coming from then i also heard you say like oh youre a girls girl for sure but i felt that you was extremely silent so i was like im im definitely not gonna give her any energy typically speaking girls girls would go up to me and say hey i know it werent nice that my brothers picked timmy for me but you know i do like the boy and i do want to crack on with him and i hope youre okay thats a girls girl but she aint do that and i just hate when people say that and they dont live up to it i mean the only thing thats between us you could say is that were interested in the same guy thats literally it like theres no reason why i would not wanna talk to you but you were like trying to like give me the cold shoulder at times i werent you were just being you were yes i mentioned multiple peoples names so whatever you felt in your heart is i feel like its a reflection of whatever you felt of my gut being right scoffs no your gut wasnt right but you just said you would pick him i dont know what to say no more you said youre gonna pick him so my gut was right babe yeah but he he and i had conversations so like my gut was right it dont matter i dont got to explain to you nothing sweetheart imagine dragons jids enemy playing but once you turn they hate us move how you gotta move and so will i it was nice talking to you i wish i could say the same yeah and even if you dont youre just a hater and i felt that from the get and bria just stormed off oh the misery everybody wants to be my enemy timmy what the fuck dude and you gotta be in the middle of that oh jeez bro spare the sympathy everybody wants to be i think i should go and talk to my sister she just dont like that what im saying makes sense shes getting upset about it yeah fuckin insecure ass people cant fuckin shits fucking annoying bro everybody wants to be my enemy look out for yourself narrator welcome back to love island usa chazz picked timmy for his sister bria which led to a showdown with zeta and its taken the wind out of brias sails dont get me fired up honey are you okay what was she saying shes trying to put it on me that im ive been giving her such bad energy like the thing is its like if you guys dont get along you dont get along who cares im like if i dont get on with you i dont get on she was like im tired of this conversation you handled that so well dyou reckon and youre the one thats like hurting yeah im the one thats not coupled with my boy im so happy she did that because thats going to make me crack on with timmy harder now and my heart is telling me to keep the boss energy in me im really glad that conversation or lack thereof really happened with bria because its just brought my energy and my like my zest back i feel like shes intentionally trying to make me like feel awkward like isolate me you know now that im uncomfortable shes more comfortable so its just like you know what im saying like i feel like shes trying to psych me out like get in my head and its pissing me off youve got to be the bigger person because if thats how she is then you know that means you have to take the higher road yeah for sure i gotta remain that way yeah just keep your cool got to stay that way i cant let nobody see me feeling no type of like just just be me yeah you know go get ready goodbye narrator felipe needs to be careful courtneys carrying a

meningitis meningococcal meningitis its an inflammation of the brain and spinal chord i cannot stress enough the next few weeks are critical all we can do is wait and see as paul grows and develops as

to me to those i love to my flesh and blood breathing heavily advertise your product or brand here contact today olivia and though my daughter did not share my blood my heart beat for her as if she did but in that moment my heart nearly stopped floor creaking gasps clears throat oh um olivia because my daughter shared not only a bed with christopher but family blood more blood than even she knew well discuss this in the drawing room when you are dressed you dont look well we just buried a body it takes something out of you mother sit im sorry you had to see that i saw nothing because it would be impossible for my daughter the young woman for whom i have sacrificed everything in this life to make such a foolish mistake i love him you will not touch my daughter you are a guest in this house what do you have to say for yourself its true were in love you cant be in love its against the laws of nature against the laws of god as if youve ever believed in god i dont believe in war yet im afraid of whats happening in europe one doesnt have to believe in something to fear its potential recourse fine lets talk about god what about the greeks or the romans their gods love everyone and anyone regardless of relation or sex dont be ridiculous you were the one who had me reading the symposium when everybody else was reading austen christopher is my other half enough do you have any idea what your father would do if he found out about this im not afraid of daddy malcolm will not understand all this could be yours one day if your father finds out what youve done what you want to continue doing its over for you youll get nothing thats a risk im willing to take you dont know what youre saying you dont know what else hes capable of theres something you dont know youre uncle and niece half uncle and niece but thats not all your blood ties are far stronger than that you are also half siblings thats not possible it is because ive been lying to you weve all been lying to you corrine i am your mother but i did not give birth to you alicia did daddy and alicia had an affair not exactly but then how can what you say be true their relations were not mutually agreed to alicia found herself pregnant garland had been dead for too long there was no way to pass you off as his so she abandoned me to you she didnt have a choice in the matter we didnt give her one so you took her child i saved her name and yours for that matter and your own were all foxworths and being a foxworth still means something because of what we did for you how we sacrificed for you a life of lies is not a sacrifice then youve never lied to help anyone but yourself everything weve discussed here everything youve done tonight i will never breathe a word of it and neither will either of you christopher if youll retire to your room so i may have a word with my daughter corrine you may not be of my blood but you are of my heart i have done everything in my power to keep the secret of your birth from the world because thats how much i love you because you are my child just as mal was just as joel is and nothing nothing you can ever do will ever change that knocking what are you doing here i dont care what my mother said it doesnt change anything youre my sister i dont love you like a brother how do you love me thats what i thought say it tell me i love you how do you love me what do we do now lets run away tonight how will we survive well have each other its easy to think its that simple but well need more than each other well need a place to live money well figure all of that stuff out you dont know what its like to have nothing i do if i have you i have everything im serious if were going to do this to really actually do this we need a plan start packing what are you doing here no daddy what have you been doing your fathers will he left half of everything to christopher your grandfather was not of sound mind when he wrote that according to whom did he see a doctor that is none of your concern but christopher couldve used this money for school or to help his mother when she was ill would you rather i had given all this up would you like to have grown up like like some some some kind of peasant girl half still wouldve been so much half is half of what i deserve i was the one who who kept those businesses running when your grandfather was off gallivanting around europe with his child bride im the one who who put up with his incompetence for all those years and im the one who suffered when my mother left exhales if you acted like this when you were a child i can see why she left crash did that feel good just like i bet it made you feel good to steal from christopher thats probably why you kept the will to remind yourself that youre so big and powerful that you can steal from a child everything that i do i do for you im so tired of hearing that tonight youre lying i i love you then act like it for once what what what about all the dolls and all the clothes and all the horses and the galas real love true love is about more than just things hits wall i wanted to give you more so much more gasps what are you doing to her stammers she she broke into the safe i thought we had an understanding about what no no no you you tell me or so help me god i i will make you regret it so now you both want me to fear a god you dont believe in its nothing really no its something its the most important something of my whole life im sorry mother but i am done lying i wont be like you or him lies are what put us here in the first place im in love with christopher and were getting married whispers you exhales christopher fighting grunts fighting grunts i will kill you just like i killed your father malcolm what are you doing daddy he cant breathe daddy stop gunshot choking groans you son of a bitch running from a fight youre a coward just like your father i found my grandfathers will half the estates yours my mother died because we couldnt afford proper medical care my father is not the coward you are say it again my fathers not a coward not just a coward hes also a murderer and a rapist corrine please tell me its not the truth mother i know what you did to my real mother our mother you told her you told her you told her slap gasps hey grunts is everyone all right whats going on here my father is trying to kill christopher youre damn right i am mrs foxworth im fine death would be a blessing compared to the devils spawn that you two would bring into this world were in love not that id expect you to understand that corrine dont youll only make things worse no im tired of this i see you daddy we all do we all know that you dont have any love in your life and yet you sit there in judgement of me and who i choose to love well if im a sinner then what exactly does that make you the man who has two daughters in this very room corrine dont celia your other daughter everybody in the house knows it everybody in town knows it because nobody chooses to be with you you have to force yourself on everyone like the beast that you are slap gasp you dont want my love so be it but you cant have my money either thats enough dont you mean christophers money if you do this with him you are not part of this family you will never have been part of this family and you will never be part of this family ever again do i make myself clear i knew what he was doing to you all those years i saw it and i didnt say anything that was wrong of me you have nothing to be sorry about my choices are my cross to bear its a burden i never wanted to share with you whats important is that youre safe now am i are you you murdered my father you raped my mother gun clicks you hit corrine now you listen to me you are not a suitable match for my daughter i love her no my boy you cant because you dont really know her of course i do no you dont because if you did you wouldnt love her she hasnt told you who she really is and you know who she is the man she hates oh she hates me because i know who she is she is a beautiful selfish girl who got rid of her own child last year just to save her reputation now it seems like i owe you some money i think its about time we made ourselves a deal and what do we do now well figure something out as long as it involves christopher my darling thats not possible you said youd support me when i found true love sighs you promised mother look into my eyes i love him im sorry not someone of your own blood may i have a moment alone with corrine to say goodbye what i spoke with your father im leaving gasps youre doing the right thing the door stays open you havent been honest with me what did you do truths can be more powerful than any weapon you told him once he knew that corrine was no more than a common slut he was more than happy to take the grand for his silence and leave you should be thanking me solving a problem that you created does not merit thanks how dare you lay a hand on my daughter she is not your daughter she is mine she always will be no i am her mother this very night i shed mrs steiners blood for her if that isnt love i dont know what is look at that you and i maybe were not so different after all corrine corrine corinne olivia everything that was mine everything i worked for everything i loved had been taken from me i had nothing left olivia i was alone all three children gone months had passed without word from corrine but losing her didnt seem to have made malcolm change his ways at all good morning darling where are you heading to town i have a couple errands to run for my grandmother would you like a ride even satan is sweating today thanks mr foxworth that sure be nice what are you doing grace do not get in that car mrs foxworth mr foxworth asked if i would like a ride to town and interrupts you wouldnt have a nice day at work dont rush back mrs foxworth what is it its a letter corrine she says she can no longer live under the same roof as her father that as long as hes alive she wont come back exhales metal clatters mrs foxworth its awful late what are you doing here i forgot something in the car earlier today and well here it is goodnight then mrs foxworth did you know that i always wanted to live in new york city no i wanted to be a singer since i was a little girl standing up on a stage lights pointing at me but i can never leave this place not with my family here i was afraid afraid of what he would do to them if i wasnt here to protect them look i understand oh do i understand ive wanted to do the same thing more times than i can count but you didnt i couldnt face my god if i did i admire your conviction but i dont share it oh maybe not but ive known you for how many years now if its not gods judgement you fear then its someone elses or maybe its your own but i feel it youve got good inside i think i used to but now im many things inside thank you nella just do me a favor if the other things get the upper hand again not like this samuels cousin is the driver it would be obvious that it wasnt an accident the police will blame one of us and i dont want to wake up with one of my boys hanging from a tree of course good night good night grunts wood cracking crash gasps ill call the doctor olivia these old houses i tell you you never know when a railing may give way to rot or decay or a handsaw olivia ive come to know myself as many things a proficient murderess is not one of them mr foxworth after six months in the hospital your husbands hemiparesis has not improved so he will most likely never speak again or regain sensation in his left side i see which means he will need assistance eating washing dressing and how is his mind oh perfect thats all that matters olivia but perhaps this was better than death to know he was trapped and i was in charge where shall i have them put him upstairs in his room will you be employing a nurse to care for him no only i can give him the comfort i know he deserves olivia like i always said the best kind of revenge takes time welcome home i know its not exactly foxworth hall well its better than that motel commotion coming from outside just until you finish medical school i know its not much but its ours and we can do anything we want here no judgement no rules nothing to be afraid of commotion coming from outside except maybe the neighbors im sorry i know its not what youre used to big band music may i have this dance oh it would be my honor mrs dollanganger oh im not sure ill ever get used to that name at least no one will ever find us this way and besides i feel it has a certain whimsy to it giggles woo jazz music plays thank you you deserve far more than a going away party for everything youve done for me no thank you for making my family safe i dont know what youre talking about for you train tickets so you can visit after you become a big star in new york i will miss you as will your many friends none of them are quite like you mrs foxworth olivia please applause mrs foxworth may i have this dance you may not leave her alone you fool i would be honored on one condition you sing the song you hear that boys my first request jazz plays im living the high life there aint no getting me down i been to hell on a railroad track i kissed the devil and i aint going back click my heels a one two three now i know what it means to be free im living the high life there aint no getting me down its just me and my liberty and no one telling me how scats i shall live my life not a cloud in the skyline im living the high life for good scats applause good afternoon gentlemen and thank you for coming here all the way from richmond im olivia winfield foxworth and due to my husbands tragic accident ill be replacing him as acting president of foxworth industries grunting and groaning oh dear it looks like hes having another one of his fits i was so hoping hed be able to join us today please take him to his room grunting and groaning im terribly sorry about that now lets get down to business shall we when exactly will mr foxworth be returning as you can see hes in no condition to work let alone be out of bed the doctors cannot be certain when or if resuming his professional responsibilities will be possible now judging by the most recent quarterly reports but we need mr foxworths approval on our yearly tax filings no actually youll be needing my approval and right now you most certainly do not have it do i make myself clear or will you continue interrupting me excellent now judging by the most recent quarterly reports it seems to me the current priority would be adjusting the supply chain back to a peacetime schedule yet i found no evidence that such an effort has been made why is that anyone well someone speak up or ill be forced to start calling on you at random i had a truly extraordinary afternoon but i suppose you know that already what a pity you couldnt stay for the rest of the board meeting you shouldve seen the looks on those miserable mens faces when they realized theyd be reporting to me from now on you just couldnt imagine or perhaps you can their expressions looked much like yours does right now professional impotence is really not a good look on men you should try better to mask your feelings im somewhat of an expert on that having lived with you for the past years but now now things are different sign these they give me control of foxworth industries perhaps i didnt make myself clear you will sign these or tomorrow i may accidentally forget to feed you id like to show you something i believe this was your mothers crash breathing heavily well that wont be possible to replace everything in this room was hers was it not grunting frantic breathing grunting frantic breathing grunting from now on there will be consequences when you dont do as youre told struggling grunts choking choking grunting labored breathing i wanted to surprise you and christopher welcome home well do you like it i adore it but can we afford it its all taken care of remember youre married to a doctor now baby crying its ok come here chris i cant believe im saying this but i really wish my mother were here to share all of this with me baby babbling gasping for breath groaning sign the damn papers oh and i wont be needing your signature again now that i control the business yelling in pain groaning in pain mr foxworth seems to have fallen would you help him up olivia and thats when i knew without my children look what i had become i was lost i needed something to cling to something or someone who would remind me what is right and what is good i needed my flesh and blood rat squeaking mrs foxworth a mr john amos to see you amos you came as if i could ever deny a wish of my dearest cousin i must say i was rather surprised by the urgent tone of your letter you see after corrine and christopher left i found myself in well rather a dark place and i suppose i was finding it increasingly difficult to find the light where it used to shine so brightly a certain amount of darkness is to be expected youve suffered tremendous loss i keep thinking some of it may have been my fault i should have found a way to open my heart to corrine and christopher absolutely not i mean that cannot be you provided everything for corrine and she chose a path of moral corruption any further contact with her would pull you into the life of sin that she has chosen to live whatever befalls her now is gods way of punishing her but not having her in my life feels like punishment to me one might ask and certainly not me if you have done anything that merits punishing i am far from perfect god does not ask for perfection he only asks for repentance i would like that very much to repent to be forgiven but you never believed i also never found happiness on the path i chose even the scientific mind does not repeat the same experiment and expect a different outcome perhaps this is an opportune time to enter a new variable into the equation sighs olivia and so i did it that night i prayed for the first time in my life i prayed for forgiveness i prayed that malcolms soul would be saved i prayed for mals spirit for joels safety and for corrines return to me from her life of sin sin i was only just beginning to fully recognize and so nearly a decade passed prayer brought me peace it did not however bring my children back to me did you ever think that being a parent would be this exhausting uh no no but even if someone had told me i would never have been able to understand my mother made it look so easy well your mother was also an expert at hiding how she felt about a lot of things hmm i think we need a vacation i can get some days off in august we can pack up the kids rent a house on the beach and just relax for a few days im not sure thats going to be possible what are you worried about money we can afford it no its not that youre pregnant another baby not exactly another two babies twins gasps giggles can we handle this hey are you kidding me i love you so damn much mrs foxworth a mr woodruff to see you yes thank you send him right in mr woodruff how good of you to come i am at your service please sit thank you i can call for tea quite all right perhaps something stronger no laughs thank you ive never done anything like this before do you require payment now or after its all the same to me i know youre good for it my husband can never know i have many clients who are wives of distinguished men i assure you i operate with the utmost discretion what would you like me to do id like you to investigate my daughter bird chirping no stroke of brush could capture the spirit behind your eyes cousin amos youre too kind and ive been less than kind to you as of late i apologize not at all and if you were which you are not im sure its because something i did offended your delicate sensibilities laughs well ive rarely been called delicate or sensible but i appreciate the sentiment and i intend to make up for my shortcomings in our relationship shortcomings thats positively absurd to think not that theres anything of the absurd about you amos i have something for you i think were done here follow me youll see it was built shortly after the main house was finished its been generations since its been used but with a little effort i thought we could turn it into something special its magnificent its yours eight years ago you answered a letter from me with your arrival at my door and youve stayed the course helping me find my way to god and forgiveness and some semblance of peace with malcolm for that i will be forever grateful its been the greatest joy of my life seeing you find faith this will do exceedingly well wood snapping gasps no one can hear us hear us doing what praying of course door creaks mr woodruff how good to see you again please sit do you have any news of my daughter i do quite a bit actually um she goes by corrine dollanganger now dollanganger laughs what a silly name why would she change it of course she would she feared exactly this my finding her please continue christopher is a doctor of obstetrics clears throat quite successful at that they live in pittsburgh this is their house their wedding they married many years ago and they have children what four of them are they normal i mean are they healthy very not only are they healthy theyre so robust and charming that folks in the town have come to call them ah here it is the dresden dolls but why because they seem to present as the perfect children from the perfect parents you can relax now your daughter has created quite a lovely life for herself olivia dresden dolls to remind me of my part in my familys sin to remind me that i must grow to be strong enough to overcome that sin and over the next five years i believed i did just that wait here may i help you phone ringing foxworth residence no mrs foxworth is not available at the moment yes this is mr foxworth i see thank you very much you just missed a call from mr woodruff oh i wasnt expecting another report so soon christopher is dead car accident apparently i thought youd want to know that christopher is dead i need your help today the aberration of christopher and corrine was born of something that something was this place it was foxworth hall and i think i know how to stop it dark choral music dear lord only once one has been deprived of frivolous pleasures and emotional distractions can one focus on whats important faith devotion and repentance today i ask for your redemption i ask for you to remove the stain of sin from foxworth hall dark choral music can you at least leave that i have four children to feed foxworth hall now reflects the new life that youve chosen one of prayer and and reflection god is proud of you rat feet pattering olivia nella what are you doing here celia wrote about christopher and i got on the next train i am so what happened why dont you join me for some sweet tea on the terrace its wonderful to see you you couldve given those things away or sold them and sent the money to someone who needed them it was a sacrifice it was symbolic of what of mrs foxworths faith amos no need for formalities nella this is my cousin john amos amos nella its a pleasure to meet you im sure it is believe it or not nella used to work here that is not at all difficult to believe but now shes a big star in new york city if you count playing a few harlem bars as being a star i do not well i very much would not want to interrupt enjoy your tea hes not accustomed to guests who look like me truth be told i dont often have visitors but now i have you and im delighted youre here lets all have dinner together tonight invite your family will mr foxworth be there in his room where he has remained since you left your mobility has much improved would you like if we said grace together before you eat very well may god bless you is everything ready for dinner were quite out of practice at entertaining arent we yes mrs foxworth but everything has been arranged this came for you thank you everything is delicious send our compliments to cook yes and tell odette shed better send me the recipe shes our cousin well shes so very talented everything is always superb isnt that right amos yes cook does her job quite well hows joel have you heard from him not in some time he could be anywhere by now i feel like each letter is from a different hemisphere tangier excuse me joel and harry thats where they are tangier harry writes us every week thats wonderful theyre going to see the pyramids next month can you even imagine no i cannot and hows corrine these days whispers sharply look what youve gone and done tearfully no no no its not her fault i received a letter today from mr woodruff apparently christopher was deeply in debt when he passed cant say im surprised the likes of him i would surmise gambling corrine and her children are in dire straits barely able to put food on the table well thats nothing you cant fix drops fork olivias not going to support that jezebel sending money would be a betrayal of gods will corrine must suffer for her sins ah you think its gods will for one of his children to starve our lords will should not be questioned it should be followed then what about free will its precisely corrines free will that led her to moral and financial destitution even if thats the case which im not saying it is who are we to judge her choices faith is about forgiveness to deserve forgiveness one must first ask for it not that i should have to explain myself to you let corrine reach the depths of her despair and be reminded of how much she needs you this is how god will bring her back to you you always said that you were her true mother this is your chance to act like it ive had quite enough of this olivia shes your baby you wont abandon her because i know you i always said you got good inside ive always believed religion is food for personal thought not for the dinner table mrs foxworth for you thank you amos is something wrong the farthest from it you were right all along destitution brought her back to me corrine has asked to come home sighs put your faith in god and youll never go astray we must celebrate tonight a special dinner lets dress for the occasion make it a night to remember yes lets sighs door opens nella i came to say goodbye i havent seen much of you these past few weeks my apologies ive been busy i remember the first night you came here you were so scared you looked how i felt yes well that was a long time ago and i knew right away that you were different you werent like them i really dont know what you mean i think you do may i remind you that the people of whom you speak are my family so youre really one of them now is that all or do you wish me to endure your judgement any longer you dont have to replace one controlling man with another he brought me to god and god is bringing corrine back to me you reached out to her no it all happened exactly as amos said it would once corrine reached a point of destitution she realized her place was here at home with me i dont know what kind of god you pray to but the one i know doesnt wait for the people we love to suffer to bring them help one must repent to be offered redemption repenting doesnt mean suffering and one small freedom does not give you access to them all watch yourself you are a guest in my house olivia i dont mrs foxworth thats just it mrs foxworth is everything you didnt want to be ill see myself out dishes clattering mr amos requested that you meet him in the chapel before dinner is served oh thank you there you are whats this all about you have hidden sin from me what are you talking about so its true yes we are only human tell me let me be your cousin and your confessor there is only one right way to confess and that is the truth there was a servant she knew about malcolm and alicia she threatened to expose corrines illegitimacy i had to stop her but it went terribly wrong and she hit her head an accident one cannot be blamed for what one never intended its what i intended but failed to do that is far worse malcolms fall i did that i wanted him dead he forced himself on me what over and over and over again and i know what youre going to say that its his right as the husband but i dont think it is you must think im a monster sobs never have you been more pure or beautiful in my eyes gasps how dare you judge my daughter for a sin you yourself so easily commit cousin i am so sorry i will not be violated by another man you will leave foxworth hall tomorrow breathing heavily gasps what are you doing here i brought you into the light you will not send me out into the darkness not until i get what ive earned struggling grunts no no panicked breathing panicked breathing choking sobbing exertion grunts spits i have news good news at least i hope you see it as good news god has given us a second chance at having a family our daughter is coming home olivia at foxworth hall the seeds of sin were planted in a garden of shadows long before i ever arrived at its gates those seeds needed blood to grow and i was foolishly bringing new blood into its walls blood that i intended to purge of sin grunting little did i know then that my efforts would give rise to the greatest evils foxworth hall had yet to see why couldnt they pick us up at the train station because your grandmother wanted our arrival to be a surprise why did you never tell us we had grandparents its complicated you see your grandparents are very wealthy extraordinarily wealthy all we have to do is be on our very best behavior make them love us a whole lot and i know that theyll take care of us forever and ever what did your father always want for you best education possible and thats exactly what they can buy for you access to the best schools trips around the world so you can actually see the places that you study in person and we will not just show up in london paris and rome we will show up wearing beautiful gowns and jewels

hmm im glad you reached out so how did your confession go fathers utterly incapable of forgiveness whats new well no father is perfect save that for the father above lucious is messed up and he passed it on to me in my opinion you cant fix your father but you can fix yourself the difference between you and lucious is that you want to do the right thing encourage that part of yourself i dont know where to start you already started you confessed you were sincere in your regret so be sincere in your apologies to those youve hurt come on you know whats so ridiculous too is that these days my father wouldnt know originality if it kicked him in the damn head well its not like eddies any better hes trying to turn me into some rb diva okay but nobody cares about genres anymore they just want good music what about our music you really think that empires just not gonna release it no i know that theyre not but why does that have to stop us you know what im saying why cant we release it under a different name what do you mean meaning dont put our names on it dont put our pictures on it cause then that way it could actually be about the music kind of like a daft punk gorillaz vibe see now you feeling me okay look we could even i dont know add some other dope musicians like start a band no better than a band like a um like a collective you know what im saying we bounce off of each other we we feed each others ideas yeah i dig that look watch this artist ive been trying to work with him for a minute i was above em no bluffin if ands or buts and aint no time for a discussion the

there what nothing for good luck back in the day i never wouldve pegged you as someone whod have a seat at the table you were always so impulsive quick to pull the trigger without even being sure that
